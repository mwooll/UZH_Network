Minor 30 Hermeneutics
Description:
General description: 
The Bachelor's Degree minor in Hermeneutics introduces the most important questions about the theory of 
interpretation and understanding. It also offers a survey of the main phases in the development of the discipline 
and present contemporary viewpoints and debates. Methods of interpretation are considered critically in relation to 
their presuppositions and implications. This minor can well be taken in combination with other fields of study 
involving interpretation (theology, study of religions, philosophy, literature studies, history, jurisprudence, social 
sciences and others). For this reason, interdisciplinary connections of this kind are a consciously planned part of 
the program.

Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in the same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Where the subject is changed, the faculty can require proof of additional competences beyond 
those acquired in the Bachelor's program. This is also applicable to acceptance onto specialized Master's courses. 
In any event, even when the Master's course is in the same subject, the faculty can make the completion of a 
Master's degree dependent on the fulfillment of additional requirements. These requirements can also be fulfilled 
during the Master's course. The details are set out in the framework rules and the study rules.

Major 90 Study of Religions
Description:
General description: 
The Bachelor's Degree major in Study of Religions teaches the analysis and interpretation of religion as an 
important factor, both past and present, in socio-cultural communication, as accomplished through methods derived 
from the social sciences and humanities. Linguistic and methodological knowledge allows an appropriate use of 
historical sources and contemporary findings. History of Religion modules deal with the emergence and 
development of various religions in their organizational forms and practices. Social sciences modules introduce the 
study of contemporary religious cultures. Systematic modules introduce religious theories and comparative 
methods. The track is completed with a Bachelor's thesis or portfolio.
Program Outcomes: 
The Bachelor's degree course in religious studies should enable a student to analyse and interpret religion and 
religions by humanities and social science methods as an important factor for socio-cultural communication in 
history and the present day. The interdisciplinary degree program encourages students to find links between 
historical and contemporary problems. Linguistic and methodical skills allow the students to handle historical 
sources and current findings in the appropriate manner. Religious history modules teach basic knowledge on the 
evolution and development of various religions, their organisational forms, convictions and practices. Socio-
scientific modules provide an introduction to the analysis and interpretation of contemporary religious cultures. 
Systematic modules present various religious theories and encourage students to compare religious 
circumstances. A range of focal programs allow specific in-depth studies. 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
The Bachelor's and Master's degree in religious studies does not prepare students for a specific profession but - 
similar to arts and social science subjects in general - teaches specialised knowledge and methodical skills that can 
be used in a variety of vocational fields:  
• the media (press, radio, TV), journalism, publishing  
• education (schools, adult education) 
 
• cultural, social and (inter)religious organisations and institutions (including churches) 
 
• academic-scientific sector 
 
• international and intercultural organisations, intercultural communication, translations 
 
• culture management, congress and exhibition organisation• tourism, tour guide 
 
• political advisor, diplomatic service, etc. 
Further Study Options: 
Earning a Bachelor’s degree automatically qualifies students to continue studying the same subject without having 
to fulfill further conditions. Should students wish to change their field of study, the faculty may request evidence of 
any skills not developed in the Bachelor’s program before granting acceptance to the Master’s program. This also 
applies to entry to specialized Master’s programs. 
 
In any event – even in the same field of study – the faculty may make the completion of the Master’s degree 
dependent upon fulfilling additional requirements. These requirements may also be fulfilled during the Master’s 
program. Details are set out in the framework ordinance and program regulations.

Minor 30 Medieval Latin Language and Literature
Description:
General description: 
The Medieval Latin Linguistics and Literature Bachelor's Degree minor provides students with an initiation into Latin 
Literature of the Middle Ages (epochs/genres/authors) as well as to academic methodological philological work and 
research. Students become trained to work independently in the analysis of Medieval Latin texts (translating and 
interpreting) and through the practice of their philological work they will inspire to develop a knowledge of the 
cultural and material conditions behind the traditions and intellectual history of the texts. Medieval Latin Linguistics 
and Literature can be studied as a first subsidiary minor or a secondary subsidiary minor. The ultimate student goal 
is varied and depends less on the educational content of the course but, rather, on the subsequent student activity 
and how comprehensively and intensely they engage with the features and issues of the field.

intersection of humanities and social sciences; it draws on theories from both areas, and its methods are primarily 
qualitative. 
Its study trains students to work analytically with respect to culture, literature and the media, aids the understanding 
of cultural and social phenomena and allows for practical applications. 
Popular Culture Studies teaches various skills useful in those areas that call for the imparting and transmitting of 
cultural knowledge. 
Areas in which graduates work include: the media, publishing, libraries, cultural exchange and culture 
management, museum work and organizing exhibitions, schools, adult education, industrial culture, social work, 
work with asylum seekers, city and settlement planning as well as tourism.

Major 90 General Linguistics
Description:
General description: 
The goal of General Linguistics is to be able to explain human language communication in all of its complexity and 
the variety and variability of its structures, with particular consideration given to universal and regional 
developments. Since the variety of human forms of speech has decreased greatly as a result of globalization, 
General Linguistics also has the important task of documenting languages and language systems which are in 
danger of disappearing for posterity. To do so, it uses its own analytical methods complemented by numerous 
general techniques such as experimental, computational and statistical or mathematical procedures. The course of 
study provides solid basic knowledge of the various sub-sections of General Linguistics and provides an 
introduction to their methods and applications. The subject naturally has an extensive interdisciplinary component.

Single Major 120 Religion – Economics – Politics
Description:
General description: 
The Master's degree program Religion – Economics – Politics is designed to link the methodological knowledge 
gained in a Bachelor's degree program in one field of study (Theology, Religious Studies, Economics and Business 
Administration, or Political Science) with fundamental approaches used in the other disciplines in the program. 
Students learn to deal with complex questions that arise at the intersection of religion and economics/religion and 
politics. Students are then required to demonstrate their abilities in a Master's dissertation. The joint degree 
Master's program is an interdisciplinary academic program designed to enable graduates to independently 
recognize and to coherently analyze and assess the interrelationship between religion, economics and politics.
Program Outcomes: 
The interdisciplinary education provided by the Joint Degree Master's program will equip students with the ability to 
independently identify, analyze and evaluate the relationship between religion, economy and politics in a focused 
way. As a result students will be ideally placed to address the challenges posed by a global economy and society, 
cross-border politics and increasing religious and cultural diversity, and to take an active role in dealing with the 
issues that arise.

information is necessary, above all in the areas of the publishing industry, librarianship, archival management, 
museum work, media and administration, and also in the areas of adult education, tourism, social services, or in 
private enterprise corporations.

Major 90 Study of Religions
Description:
General description: 
The degree program Study of Religions (major subject) at the Bachelor’s level enables students to employ methods 
from the humanities and social sciences when analyzing and interpreting religion as a significant factor in 
sociocultural communication in both the past and the present. 
By developing skills in languages and methodology, students learn to deal appropriately with historical sources and 
current findings. Modules in the history of religion explore the rise and development of various religions, their forms 
of organization and their practices. Modules in social sciences deal with the study of religion in contemporary 
society. 
Systematic modules introduce theories of religion and methods of comparison. A Bachelor’s dissertation or a 
Bachelor's portfolio rounds off the degree program.
Program Outcomes: 
Please see the description of the degree program. 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Das Bachelor- und Master-Studium der Religionswissenschaft bereitet nicht auf einen bestimmten Beruf vor, 
sondern vermittelt – wie Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaften generell – Sachwissen und Methodenkompetenzen, 
die in verschiedenen Berufsfeldern angewandt werden können: 
 
- Medienbereich (Presse, Radio, TV), Journalismus, Publizistik, Verlagswesen 
- Bildungswesen (Schulen , Erwachsenenbildung) 
- kulturell, sozial und (inter)religiös tätige Organisationen und Institutionen (u. a. Kirchen) 
- akademisch-wissenschaftlicher Bereich 
- international und interkulturell arbeitende Organisationen, Kulturvermittlung, Übersetzung 
- Kulturmanagement, Kongress- und Ausstellungsorganisation 
 
- Tourismus, Reiseleitung 
- Politikberatung, diplomatischer Dienst usw. 
 
Further Study Options: 
Earning a Bachelor’s degree automatically qualifies students to continue studying the same subject without having 
to fulfill further conditions. Should students wish to change their field of study, the faculty may request evidence of 
any skills not developed in the Bachelor’s program before granting acceptance to the Master’s program. This also 
applies to entry to specialized Master’s programs. 
 
In any event – even in the same field of study – the faculty may make the completion of the Master’s degree 
dependent upon fulfilling additional requirements. These requirements may also be fulfilled during the Master’s 
program. Details are set out in the framework ordinance and program regulations.

Major Veterinary Medicine
Description:
General description: 
The Bachelor’s degree program in Veterinary Medicine deals with all measures that promote animal health and 
wellbeing, including breeding, husbandry, nutrition, and treatment of diseases. Students acquire the skills needed 
to carry out research on the prevention and treatment of diseases, and gain the knowledge necessary for 
protecting humans against illnesses contracted from animals and for monitoring animal-based foodstuffs. The 
degree program also familiarizes students with issues of animal and environmental protection. 
Upon earning their Bachelor's degree in Veterinary Medicine, graduates are qualified to continue their studies in a 
Master's degree program.
Program Outcomes: 
The Bachelor’s degree in Veterinary Medicine furnishes students with a good background in scientific, veterinary 
and medical knowledge, basic skills for veterinary procedures and basic clinical knowledge. 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
The Bachelor’s degree program does not prepare students to immediately embark on a career as a vet, but 
provides students with the knowledge necessary to move on to the Master’s degree program in veterinary 
medicine. Following completion of the Bachelor’s degree program, students of Veterinary Medicine generally study 
toward a Master’s degree in the field. Completing the Master’s degree program and passing the final state 
examination are the prerequisites for practicing veterinary medicine.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in the same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Where the subject is changed, the faculty can require proof of additional competences beyond 
those acquired in the Bachelor's program. This is also applicable to acceptance onto specialized Master's courses. 
In any event, even when the Master's course is in the same subject, the faculty can make the completion of a 
Master's degree dependent on the fulfillment of additional requirements. These requirements can also be fulfilled 
during the Master's course. The details are set out in the framework rules and the study rules.

Program Structure: The modular degree program takes three years. The first year provides a foundation in 
science and veterinary medicine. In the second and third years students tackle clinical 
issues. Modular, organ-based courses provide a comprehensive education through the 
combination of foundation courses and clinical subjects. Students are also expected to 
expand their knowledge of other areas – e.g. microbiology, genetics, animal nutrition – 
in non-organ-based courses.

Doctoral Program Computational Science
Description:
General description: 
The doctoral program in Computational Science includes a written dissertation about the own independent scientific 
research project. The program includes a 
curricular part of at least 12 ECTS credits. The curricular part is determined individually for each doctoral student 
through the doctoral committee and focuses on the specific environment of the research area but also considers a 
general computational science education. Per year, the visit of at least one scientific congress or summer school, 
relevant to the own research area, is compulsory. The regular participation in weekly research seminars is strongly 
encouraged (no ECTS credits). Additionally, doctoral students must take at least one teaching load in each 
semester.

Admission Requirements: 
Admission to doctoral study is governed by the ordinance on admission to studies at the University of Zurich 
(Verordnung über die Zulassung an der Universität Zürich VZS). The main requirement for admission to doctoral 
study is a Master's degree from a university or an equivalent degree. Each PhD project must receive approval from 
a professor at the Faculty of Science or from a person who has the right to confer a PhD at the Faculty of Science. 
There is no general right to be granted admission to a PhD program. Admission may be made contingent on 
conditions and/or restrictions in the form of additional coursework. Conditions must be met prior to admission to 
doctoral study; restrictions may be fulfilled during doctoral study. Coursework required to meet conditions and/or 
restrictions may not exceed a total of 60 ECTS credits; requirements are specified according to the demands of the 
subject in which the PhD thesis will be written. The Vice Dean of Studies decides on admission, on recognition of 
similar degrees, and on conditions and/or additional requirements that may apply. As a rule, the language of 
instruction in the PhD programs is English. All applicants whose native language is not English, or whose prior 
studies have not been conducted in English, are required to provide proof of sufficient knowledge of English.

General description: 
The Master’s minor study program in Earth System Science (30 ECTS credits) is part of the most comprehensive 
Earth Science program in Switzerland. It is offered by the Faculty of Science (MNF) of the University of Zurich 
(UZH) in collaboration with the Department of Earth Sciences (D-ERDW) of the Swiss Federal Institute of 
Technology (ETHZ). The minor study program Earth System Science at the Master's level forms a continuation of a 
successfully completed minor study program Earth System Science at the Bachelor’s level and further deepens 
that knowledge. The minor further elaborates on the scientific principles and enables the student to focus on one or 
a few domains within Earth System Science. The ability to work and think in a scientific-methodological way forms 
a key skill within the minor. The total workload of 30 ECTS credits can be extended based on the individual interest 
in one of the Earth spheres.
Program Outcomes: 
Within the minor study program in Earth System Science 30 students study analyze current issues using an 
interdisciplinary approach. The program combines scientific fundamentals with advanced modules in Earth System 
Science. 
In teaching, in-depth knowledge from current research projects is presented and students are encouraged to 
critically examine socially relevant topics. 
Practical experience in measurement techniques, experimental methods and application-oriented data analysis 
complement the study program.

Single Major 180 Biology
Description:
General description: 
The single major study program in Biology (180 ECTS credits) provides students with a general education in 
Natural Sciences, knowledge in all research areas of Biology and the capability to think and work methodically and 
scientifically. Course components: In the compulsory modules (90 ECTS credits) of the basic studies curriculum, 
students learn important concepts in all biological disciplines, from the molecular level, through genes, cells, 
individuals, populations and up to ecosystems. At the same time students gain basic knowledge of Mathematics, 
Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry. Following their interests, students choose core elective modules (30 ECTS 
credits) of biology-related fields already during their basic studies. During the advanced studies curriculum (60 
ECTS credits) students develop their knowledge in areas of their choice in block courses and special lectures and 
in elective modules.
Program Outcomes: 
A bachelor major study program Biology taken for 150 or 120 ECTS imparts the same foundational knowledge on 
students as a single major study program (180 ECTS), but they differ in the breadth of knowledge that is taught. 
Both options teach students foundational theory and praxis in Biology as well as in other foundational subjects in 
the natural sciences. Students learn to think and work systematically and scientifically. 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
With a BSc in biology, graduates have the necessary theoretical and practical qualifications for the Master's degree 
course in one of the consecutive Master's concentrations in biology, and depending on the choice of optional core 
modules, for the Master's program in biomedicine, biochemistry and specialized Master programs such as 
biostatistics or environmental science. The first degree of BSc in biology is also suitable for a start in all types of 
training and education programs of private and public companies.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in the same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Where the subject is changed, the faculty can require proof of additional competences. This is 
also applicable to acceptance onto specialized Master's programs.

Major/Minor-Combinations: A study program Biology 180 is a single major study program. A major study program 
Biology 120 can be combined with a minor study program 60. A major study program 
Biology 150 can be combined with a minor study program 30. Minor study programs 
can be chosen from the entire range of subjects offered by the University of Zurich. A 
minor study program starts in the second year of study.
Part-Time Studies: The basic studies of the Bachelor's degree program in biology are particularly suitable 
for part-time studies. This naturally leads though to a prolonged period of studies. The 
order of the compulsory modules during basic studies in the regular degree program is 
not binding. If basic studies are completed in 6 or 8 instead of 4 semesters you should 
nevertheless try to complete the mathematics before the physics and the chemistry 
before the biochemistry elements. The third regular year of studies for the Bachelor's 
degree (advanced studies) contains block courses and lectures that take up the whole 
working week. Part-time students thus have to organize their time in advanced studies 
to ensure their presence in coherent time blocks of at least three and a half weeks.

knowledge in scientific, biological and medical subjects as well as in biostatistics and bioinformatics in the solution 
of biomedical questions in theory and practice and to recognize, describe and explain biomedical concepts and 
phenomena. 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
A permanent professional position is hardly possible with a Bachelor’s degree, at best it is only possible to do an 
internship or to enter a training program in private or public companies. The prerequisite for employment is 
normally a Master’s degree.
Further Study Options: 
The Single Major degree in Biomedicine at the Bachelor’s level (Major Study Program worth 180 ECTS Credits) 
entitles to enrol for the Major Study Programs in Biomedicine at the Master’s level with no further conditions. The

Organization:
Program Structure: The compulsory modules (113 ECTS) and elective modules (7 ECTS) of the basic 
studies (1st-4th semester) cover the natural sciences (chemistry, physics, 
biochemistry), the basic and applied mathematics (analysis, statistics, programming, 
data analysis), the relevant biological subjects (molecular genetics, cell biology, 
evolution and developmental biology of humans, microbiology, neurobiology, systems 
biology) and the medical subjects (anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, 
immunology, virology, histology). In the elective modules (60 ECTS) of the advanced 
studies (5th and 6th semester), knowledge of molecular and cellular mechanisms of 
important human diseases is acquired, as well as biomedical research methods for 
their diagnosis, therapy and prevention. The main part of the 3rd year of study is 
formed by practical courses in research courses of the Faculty (e.g. in the Institutes of 
Physiology, Medical Virology, Experimental Immunology, Molecular Cancer Research, 
Pharmacology and Toxicology, Molecular Life Sciences, Anatomy, Quantitative 
Biomedicine, etc.) and in various University hospitals in Zurich. 
There, students get the possibility to find their thematic priority within biomedicine or to 
choose a program within the Biology Master. 
Major/Minor-Combinations: The Bachelor's study program Biomedicine 180 is a single major study program. No 
minor studs program can be taken.
Part-Time Studies: Part-time studies are well possible due to the modular structure of the basic study 
period. However, the duration of studies will be extended and it must be noted that the 
sequence of compulsory modules of the basic study period is constructive. The third 
regular year of studies for the Bachelor's degree (advanced studies) contains block 
courses and lectures that take up the whole working week. Part-time students thus 
have to organize their time in advanced studies to ensure their presence in coherent 
time blocks of at least three and a half weeks. If necessary, the study counselling 
service can be contacted.

A bachelor’s major study program in Chemistry taken for 150 or 120 ECTS imparts the same foundational 
knowledge on students as a single major study program (180 ECTS), but they differ in the breadth of knowledge 
that is taught. Both options teach students foundational theory and praxis in Chemistry as well as in other 
foundational subjects in the natural sciences. Students learn to think and work systematically and scientifically and 
acquire the subject-specific qualifications necessary to teach Chemistry as their second teaching subject at Upper 
Secondary Schools (Sekundarstufe II). 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
The Bachelor’s degree is a suitable qualification for entry into a career requiring a general scientific degree. 
 
Our world needs experts in chemistry across the entire range of human endeavor. Chemistry is the driving force for 
finance and the market, it has an influence on health and the environment, and makes significant contributions to 
the development of art and entertainment.
Further Study Options: 
Successful completion of the BSc entitles students to continue studying the same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Should a student wish to change his or her field of study, the faculty may demand evidence of 
any competences not covered by the Bachelor's program before accepting the student onto the Master's program. 
This also applies to entry into specialized Master's programs. In any event, the Faculty may make the completion of 
the Master's degree dependent on fulfillment of additional requirements. These requirements may also be fulfilled 
during the Master's program. Details are set out in the framework rules and study guidelines.

Major 150 Biology
Description:
General description: 
The major study program in Biology (150 ECTS credits) provides students with a general education in Natural 
Sciences, knowledge in all research areas of Biology and the capability to think and work methodically and 
scientifically. 
Course components: In the compulsory modules (90 ECTS credits) of the basic studies curriculum, students learn 
important concepts in all biological disciplines, from the molecular level, through genes, cells, individuals, 
populations and up to ecosystems. At the same time students gain basic knowledge of Mathematics, Physics, 
Chemistry and Biochemistry. Following their interests, students choose core elective modules (15 ECTS credits) of 
biology-related fields already during their basic studies. During the advanced studies curriculum (45 ECTS credits) 
students develop their knowledge in areas of their choice in block courses and special lectures.
Program Outcomes: 
A bachelor major study program Biology taken for 150 or 120 ECTS imparts the same foundational knowledge on 
students as a single major study program (180 ECTS), but they differ in the breadth of knowledge that is taught. 
Both options teach students foundational theory and praxis in Biology as well as in other foundational subjects in 
the natural sciences. Students learn to think and work systematically and scientifically. 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
With a BSc in biology, graduates have the necessary theoretical and practical qualifications for the Master's degree 
course in one of the consecutive Master's concentrations in biology, and depending on the choice of optional core 
modules, for the Master's program in biomedicine, biochemistry and specialized Master programs such as 
biostatistics or environmental science. The first degree of BSc in biology is also suitable for a start in all types of 
training and education programs of private and public companies.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in the same subject without having to fulfill

Part-Time Studies: The basic studies of the Bachelor's degree program in biology are particularly suitable 
for part-time studies. This naturally leads though to a prolonged period of studies. The 
order of the compulsory modules during basic studies in the regular degree program is 
bottom-up. The third regular year of studies for the Bachelor's degree (advanced 
studies) contains block courses and lectures that take up the whole working week. 
Part-time students thus have to organize their time in advanced studies to ensure their 
presence in coherent time blocks of at least three and a half weeks. The instrument for 
planning individual programs of studies is the guideline on studying biology at the

The study of Mathematics at UZH offers a broad education in the foundations of Mathematics. The program fosters 
students ability independently to think inter-connectedly and scientifically. Students take on personal responsibility 
for their work process, the composition of their studies and for their future careers. In the face of challenges 
involved with their studies, students can distinguish themselves by demonstrating a high degree of creativity, 
flexibility, motivation and collegiality. 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
An increasing number of fields (engineering sciences, economics, medicine, etc.) in our world are being "infiltrated" 
by mathematics and its applications. Which is why the career opportunities for mathematicians and very good and 
extremely varied. The skills trained and knowledge acquired during your studies lead to a broad spectrum of 
possibilities. Mathematicians are needed, for example, in: 
 
- innovative high-tech companies 
 
- companies with a natural sciences or engineering profile 
 
- software firms or software departments of larger companies 
 
- insurance companies and banks 
 
- the teaching profession. 
 
Well-trained mathematicians are inestimably important, not least because they ensure the upcoming generation of 
scientists in information technology as well as engineering and natural sciences.
Further Study Options: 
The Bachelor degree can be followed by master’s studies. The Bachelor degree should not be understood so much 
as a professional qualification; there has as yet been no specific demand for a Bachelor in Mathematics on the part 
of business. Rather it is seen as a bridge to Master studies or acts a mobility hinge to begin a Masters academic 
program at a different university or in different subject areas.

Part-Time Studies: The basic studies of the Bachelor's degree program in biology are particularly suitable 
for part-time studies. This naturally leads though to a prolonged period of studies. The 
order of the compulsory modules during basic studies in the regular degree program is 
bottom-up. The third regular year of studies for the Bachelor's degree (advanced 
studies) contains block courses and lectures that take up the whole working week. 
Part-time students thus have to organize their time in advanced studies to ensure their 
presence in coherent time blocks of at least three and a half weeks. The instrument for 
planning individual programs of studies is the guideline on studying biology at the

Major 120 Geography
Description:
General description: 
The major study program in Geography (120 ECTS credits) provides a general education in Geo sciences and 
covers all three thematic subject areas of Geography (Physical Geography, Human Geography and Geographic 
Information Science &amp; Remote Sensing) and builds the capability to think and work in a systematic and 
scientific way. The course is structured through ECTS credits: The first two years include compulsory modules in 
Geography, Earth Sciences and Mathematics. The third year includes a Bachelor's research project and further 
compulsory modules that consolidate knowledge gained over the thematic subject areas. Further ECTS credits 
must be gained from a wide range of optional modules, wherein individuals can choose to focus on a particular 
area.
Program Outcomes: 
The Bachelor's degree in Geography provides an understanding of basic concepts and current trends of 
development in the subject. It is characterized by a broad and fundamental education and offers opportunities for 
thematic consolidation in the final year of study. The subject combines approaches from the natural, social and 
computer sciences, thus offering a unique combination of research perspectives. In teaching, in-depth knowledge 
from current research projects is presented in order to critically examine socially relevant topics. 
Students’ intellectual abilities and networked thinking are encouraged to prepare them for their future educational 
path. 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
The Bachelor's degree is a prerequisite for a Master's degree at the University of Zurich (UZH) or at another 
university and does not constitute a professional qualification. A Master's degree in another major study program is 
generally possible with the Bachelor's degree in Geography, but may be subject to conditions and additional 
requirements depending on the study program. Graduates of the Department of Geography are in demand on the 
job market, due to their methodological-theoretical and application-oriented skills. The fields of employment are 
diverse (e.g. in the fields of spatial planning, environment, landscape and human beings, geoinformatics and 
communication or teaching at secondary schools) and usually depend on the thematic consolidation chosen in the 
Master's program. 
Further Study Options: 
Earning a Bachelor’s degree automatically qualifies students to continue studying the same subject without having 
to fulfill further conditions. Should students wish to change their field of study, the faculty may demand evidence of 
any skills not developed the Bachelor’s study program before granting acceptance to a Master’s study program. 
This also applies to entry to specialized Master’s study programs. 
In any event - even in the same field of study - the faculty may make the completion of the Master’s degree 
dependent upon meeting additional requirements. These requirements may also be fulfilled during the Master’s 
study program. Details are set out in the framework rules and study regulations.

Admission Requirements: 
The conditions for admission to the Bachelor’s degree programme are regulated in: „Verordnung über die 
Zulassung zum Studium an der Universität Zürich (VZS)".

Regulations: 
Organization:
Program Structure: The first two years of the study program mainly consist of compulsory modules in 
Geography, Earth Sciences and Mathematics. The third year of the study program 
comprises a Bachelor’s thesis as well as elective modules that allow initial 
specializations within the thematic areas (see above). The program is supplemented 
with further consolidation and elective modules in Geography and related disciplines. 
Within the elective area, individual thematic focuses can be set.
Major/Minor-Combinations: A study program in Geography 180 at Bachelor’s level is a single major study program. 
A major study program in Geography 120 at Bachelor’s level can be combined with a 
minor study program 60. A major study program in Geography 150 at Bachelor’s level 
can be combined with a minor study program 30. 
Minor study programs can be chosen from the entire range of subjects offered by the 
University of Zurich. Possible minor study programs at ETH Zurich are listed on the 
website of the Department of Geography. A minor study program starts in the second 
year of study. 
Part-Time Studies: Studying part-time is possible, but not recommended. However, the maximum period 
of 12 semesters (double the standard period of study) must not be exceeded. An exact 
planning of the part-time study is necessary and should take place in consultation with 
the Student Advisory Board.

Program Structure: For a minor study program in Earth System Science 30 introductory modules are 
attended in various fields such as Earth System Science, Geology, Remote Sensing 
and Geographical Information Science. Subsequently, the interdisciplinary knowledge 
is expanded with modules in Earth System Science and Geography. These modules 
foster the knowledge within the thematic subject areas of Earth System Science: The 
Geo-Biosphere System, the Hydro-Atmosphere System and the Human-Environment 
System. 
Due to the fact that some modules are part of both study programs, there are some 
differences in the study structure for students with the major in Geography (details on 
the website of the Department of Geography).

Doctoral Program Theoretical Astrophysics and Cosmology
Description:
General description: 
The doctoral program in Theoretical Astrophysics and Cosmology is focused on carrying out original research. By 
the end of their PhD, doctoral students 
have typically published several papers in the main refereed astrophysics journals. The program includes a 
curricular part for which doctoral students must obtain at least 12 ECTS credits. These can be obtained in a variety 
of ways, such as by attending graduate schools, giving talks at conferences or by attending advanced lectures. 
Appropriate lecture courses will be chosen by the PhD advisor together with the doctoral student. Doctoral students 
are encouraged to attend weekly research seminars and the astrophysics journal club. 
Additionally, doctoral students must assist with a lecture course for five semesters, for example, holding a problems 
class.

Admission Requirements: 
Admission to doctoral study is governed by the ordinance on admission to studies at the University of Zurich 
(Verordnung über die Zulassung an der Universität Zürich VZS). The main requirement for admission to doctoral 
study is a Master's degree from a university or an equivalent degree. Each PhD project must receive approval from 
a professor at the Faculty of Science or from a person who has the right to confer a PhD at the Faculty of Science. 
There is no general right to be granted admission to a PhD program. Admission may be made contingent on 
conditions and/or restrictions in the form of additional coursework. Conditions must be met prior to admission to 
doctoral study; restrictions may be fulfilled during doctoral study. Coursework required to meet conditions and/or 
restrictions may not exceed a total of 60 ECTS credits; requirements are specified according to the demands of the 
subject in which the PhD thesis will be written. The Vice Dean of Studies decides on admission, on recognition of 
similar degrees, and on conditions and/or additional requirements that may apply. As a rule, the language of 
instruction in the PhD programs is English. All applicants whose native language is not English, or whose prior 
studies have not been conducted in English, are required to provide proof of sufficient knowledge of English.

Minor 30 Ethics
Description:
General description: 
The Ethics minor study program is offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences for Bachelor's students in the 
Faculty of Economics, Business Administration and Informatics, and the Faculty of Science. It gives insights into a 
coherent field of interrelated themes and disciplines, and allows students to choose their own area of focus. 
Ethics deals with moral, social, and political issues against the backdrop of an exploration of the methodological 
and technical fundamentals of moral theories. Among other things the program is designed to enable participants 
to acquire a basic knowledge of the methodology of practical philosophy, familiarity with the classical conception of 
moral and ethical argumentation, and the ability to methodically reflect on ethical issues, and discuss or work with 
them independently at a high level of rational discourse.
Program Outcomes: 
The goals of the program include the acquisition of knowledge of key concepts, problems, and theories in the field 
of ethics. Students gain insights into the history of western ideas and concepts, and become familiar with the 
distinctive nature of ethical issues and argumentation. They learn appropriate ways of talking and writing about 
philosophical texts and argumentation, and how to deploy specific tools and resources. The program is designed to 
promote enhanced analytical and reflective skills, keen methodological awareness, cultivated linguistic and 
argumentative skills, and hermeneutic competence. 
Students of ethics also learn how to critically question assumptions.

Minor 30 Cultural Contexts
Description:
General description: 
The Cultural Contexts minor study program is offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences for Bachelor's 
students in the Faculty of Economics, Business Administration and Informatics, and the Faculty of Science. It gives 
insights into a coherent field of interrelated themes and disciplines, and allows students to choose their own area of 
focus. 
Contextual cultural knowledge is vital in terms of enabling academic disciplines to position themselves historically 
and globally. This knowledge is acquired through an exploration of the temporally and geographically unfamiliar, as 
well as through closer investigation and analysis of the supposedly familiar. 
The study program is designed to give participants a fundamental grounding in cultural theory, cultural history, and 
interculturality, a basic knowledge of the theory and practice of cultural and artistic forms of expression, and the 
ability to reflect on and bridge cultural differences.
Program Outcomes: 
The goals of the program are for participants to a) acquire a basic knowledge of cultural theory and cultural history; 
b) rehearse intercultural dialogue (through contextual studies or language acquisition); and c) engage with cultural 
forms of expression (literature, music, visual arts, and film).

Minor 30 History, Society, Politics
Description:
General description: 
The History, Society, Politics minor study program is offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences for 
Bachelor's students in the Faculty of Business, Economics and Informatics, and the Faculty of Science. Social and 
societal contexts have a great influence on academic disciplines, and help determine how research in these 
disciplines is accepted, promoted, and implemented. An understanding of the temporal and social dimensions and 
of political decisionmaking is therefore an important component of successful research and its application in 
society. This minor study program is designed to address this point of intersection by endeavoring to give 
participants a deeper insight into history, society, and politics. Participants can set their own area of focus through 
their choice of modules.
Program Outcomes: 
Students completing the course will be able to place the knowledge acquired in their major subject in a social, 
political, and historical context, and reflect on it accordingly.

Minor 30 Digital Humanities and Text Mining
Description:
General description: 
The Digital Humanities and Text Mining minor study program is offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences 
for Bachelor's students in the Faculty of Business, Economics and Informatics, and the Faculty of Science. It gives 
insights into a coherent disciplinary field of interrelated themes and content, and allows students to choose their 
own area of focus. We live in a knowledge society where information is generally available in digital, often textual, 
form. While the information needs vary from subject to subject, there is a common denominator, as they all require 
methods and tools to automatically mark and extract the information sought in texts. The Digital Humanities and 
Text Mining study program provides an introduction to the methods and tools used in the computer-aided analysis 
of documents. The methods and knowledge acquired by participants will enable them to do simple analyses in their 
own field.
Program Outcomes: 
The goals of the program include the acquisition of a basic knowledge of programming and the methods and tools 
used to analyze digital documents.

Description:
General description: 
The study program in Computational Linguistics and Language Technology imparts a knowledge of the theory and 
practice of the automatic computer processing of language in both its spoken and – above all – its written forms. 
Those completing it are able to analyze issues related to computational linguistics, create language technology 
programs in line with best IT practice, and empirically evaluate them using annotated data. They have mastered at 
least one programming language, and are familiar with the application of machine learning, including neuronal 
technologies. Besides being well versed in the procedures of language technology, they have acquired an in-depth 
knowledge of a wide variety of topics such as machine translation, text mining, the semantic web, and parsing. In 
addition to teaching applied practical skills, the study program also gives an insight into the fundamental theoretical 
approaches of computational linguistics and language technology.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich vier Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Softwareentwicklung im Bereich Sprachtechnologie (IT-Firmen): Im 
Tätigkeitsfeld Softwareentwicklung plant und entwickelt man sprachtechnologische Software. 
Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, die Anforderungen zu analysieren, IT-Lösungen zu entwickeln und 
Systeme zu programmieren. Die konkreten Aufgaben hängen dabei vom jeweiligen Anwendungsgebiet ab. 
(2) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, 
Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert 
man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, 
Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich 
Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von Medienberichten, automatische 
Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme 
und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, Kundenanfragen etc.) sind 
Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(3) Terminologie und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(4) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder in der Behörde beinhalten. Die 
Aufgabe besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten 
und zu vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte 
sind in bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. 
Consulting umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der 
Risiken beim Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie.

Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich vier Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Softwareentwicklung im Bereich Sprachtechnologie (IT-Firmen): Im 
Tätigkeitsfeld Softwareentwicklung plant und entwickelt man sprachtechnologische Software. 
Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, die Anforderungen zu analysieren, IT-Lösungen zu entwickeln und 
Systeme zu programmieren. Die konkreten Aufgaben hängen dabei vom jeweiligen Anwendungsgebiet ab. 
(2) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, 
Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert 
man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, 
Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich 
Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von Medienberichten, automatische 
Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme 
und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, Kundenanfragen etc.) sind 
Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(3) Terminologie und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(4) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder in der Behörde beinhalten. Die 
Aufgabe besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten 
und zu vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte 
sind in bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. 
Consulting umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der 
Risiken beim Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie.

Description:
General description:

management, and know the basics of qualitative and quantitative data analytics. They are familiar with the practice 
of scientific work, presentation, and publication, have an in-depth knowledge of their elective subjects, and have 
built an appropriate portfolio of languages.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Wie viele andere universitäre Studienprogramme führt das Studium der Vergleichenden Sprachwissenschaft nicht 
zu einem bestimmten Beruf. Eines der wichtigsten späteren Tätigkeitsfelder ist die Forschung, die je nach Profil 
ganz unterschiedlich aussehen kann. Interesse an Sprache(n), Freude an Analyse und selbständiges Arbeiten sind 
aber in jedem Fall wichtige Komponenten. 
Ausserhalb der Universität ist es dank des interdisziplinären Charakters des Studienprogramms möglich, in viele 
Bereiche einzusteigen, insbesondere aber in einen der vielen Berufe, die mit Sprache, Text und Kommunikation zu 
tun haben, wie z. B. Lektorat, PR-Beratung, Übersetzung oder Sprachlehre. Je nach Interesse können die 
Kenntnisse von nicht-europäischen Sprachen, die während des Studiums erworben werden, sowie die zusätzlichen 
Qualifikationen aus den Nebenfächern auch als Grundlage dienen, in anderen Feldern wie 
Entwicklungszusammenarbeit oder Computerlinguistik tätig zu werden.

Minor 60 Comparative Linguistics
Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program have acquired fundamental specialist knowledge in all areas of linguistics, and have 
mastered the analytical skills of the discipline. They have a fundamental knowledge of linguistic theories and 
methods, especially in relation to comparative language research. They have a command of digital data editing and 
management, and know the basics of qualitative and quantitative data analytics. They are familiar with the practice 
of scientific work, presentation, and publication, have an in-depth knowledge of their elective subjects, and have 
built an appropriate portfolio of languages.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Wie viele andere universitäre Studienprogramme führt das Studium der Vergleichenden Sprachwissenschaft nicht 
zu einem bestimmten Beruf. Eines der wichtigsten späteren Tätigkeitsfelder ist die Forschung, die je nach Profil 
ganz unterschiedlich aussehen kann. Interesse an Sprache(n), Freude an Analyse und selbständiges Arbeiten sind 
aber in jedem Fall wichtige Komponenten. 
Ausserhalb der Universität ist es dank des interdisziplinären Charakters des Studienprogramms möglich, in viele 
Bereiche einzusteigen, insbesondere aber in einen der vielen Berufe, die mit Sprache, Text und Kommunikation zu 
tun haben, wie z. B. Lektorat, PR-Beratung, Übersetzung oder Sprachlehre. Je nach Interesse können die 
Kenntnisse von nicht-europäischen Sprachen, die während des Studiums erworben werden, sowie die zusätzlichen 
Qualifikationen aus den Nebenfächern auch als Grundlage dienen, in anderen Feldern wie 
Entwicklungszusammenarbeit oder Computerlinguistik tätig zu werden.

Major 90 Evolutionary Language Science
Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program are equipped with the specialist linguistic knowledge required to analyze language 
evolution. They have mastered an interdisciplinary approach to language(s) and language development from the 
perspective of biology, anthropology, and cognitive science. They have advanced knowledge of quantitative and 
qualitative analytical methods, experience with the interdisciplinary presentation of research and its findings, and 
are capable of designing and conducting interdisciplinary research.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
Wie viele andere universitäre Studienprogramme führt das Studium der Evolutionären Linguistik nicht zu einem 
bestimmten Beruf. Eines der wichtigsten späteren Tätigkeitsfelder ist die Forschung, die je nach Profil ganz 
unterschiedlich aussehen kann. Interesse an Sprache(n), Freude an Analyse und selbständiges Arbeiten sind aber 
in jedem Fall wichtige Komponenten. Ausserhalb der Universität ist es dank des interdisziplinären Charakters des 
Studienprogramms möglich, in viele Bereiche einzusteigen, insbesondere aber in einen der vielen Berufe, die mit 
Sprache, Text und Kommunikation zu tun haben, wie z. B. Lektorat, PR-Beratung, Übersetzung oder Sprachlehre. 
Je nach Interesse können die Kenntnisse von nicht-europäischen Sprachen, die während des Studiums erworben 
werden, sowie die zusätzlichen Qualifikationen aus den Nebenfächern auch als Grundlage dienen, in anderen 
Feldern wie Entwicklungszusammenarbeit oder Computerlinguistik tätig zu werden.

Single Major 120 Philosophy
Description:
General description: 
Philosophy is concerned with the fundamental questions of human existence. By considering human beings as 
sentient, thinking, and cognizant beings and as social, political, and acting subjects, philosophy reflects on the 
fundamentals and conditions not only of science, the mind, and language, but of society and culture. Besides a 
knowledge of the history of philosophy (from antiquity and the Middle Ages to the early modern period and the 19th 
and 20th centuries), the study covers key concepts, problems, and theories from various areas of contemporary 
philosophy (logic and the philosophy of science, metaphysics, cognitive theory, the philosophy of language, 
philosophy of mind, general and applied ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics).
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Die Studierenden der Philosophie erwerben Fähigkeiten, die sie in zahlreichen Berufsfeldern einbringen können. 
Zu den im Studium erworbenen Kompetenzen gehören eine hohe Analyse- und Reflexionskompetenz, ein 
ausgeprägtes methodologisches Bewusstsein, ausgebildete sprachliche, kommunikative, hermeneutische und 
argumentative Fähigkeiten sowie die Fähigkeit und Bereitschaft, Gegebenes kritisch zu hinterfragen. 
Absolventinnen und Absolventen der Philosophie findet man entsprechend in den verschiedensten Bereichen: an 
Gymnasien und Universitäten, in der Kultur und der Politik, zum Beispiel als Kulturmanager oder Diplomatinnen. 
Sie sitzen in Ethikkommissionen ein, beraten Unternehmen und Parteien, sie engagieren sich in NGOs, arbeiten 
als Medienschaffende, als Lektoren in Verlagen oder als Analystinnen in Banken und Versicherungen. 
Wer an philosophischer Forschung interessiert ist, kann nach erfolgreich absolviertem Masterstudium in 
Philosophie ein Dissertationsprojekt verfolgen und eine akademische Lauf- bahn einschlagen. Eine begrenzte 
Anzahl von Assistenzstellen ist mit der Möglichkeit einer Promotion verbunden. 
Dissertationsprojekte werden auch durch den Forschungskredit der UZH und den Schweizerischen Nationalfonds 
(SNF) gefördert. Zusätzlich besteht die Möglichkeit, eine Promotion im Rahmen grösserer Forschungsprojekte 
durchzuführen.

Major 90 Film Studies
Description:
General description: 
The Film Studies major places film in the historical and current context of the arts and media of the 20th and 21st 
centuries. It imparts a deeper knowledge of the history, theory, aesthetics, and technology of film and the cinema. It 
places special emphasis on extending students’ ability to link audiovisual artifacts with other media and arts, and to 
embed them in a broader discursive setting on an interdisciplinary basis. By equipping students to do their own 
methodologically reflective research and engage on an historical-critical basis with the subject at the interface with 
practice, the study program qualifies them for an academic career, but equally for demanding work in film culture, 
the film business, or film policy.

Minor 30 Film Studies
Description:
General description: 
The minor in Film Studies develops in more depth the basic film aesthetics skills acquired at Bachelor’s level and 
students’ knowledge of the history and theory of film. It equips them to critically engage with current and historical 
developments in film and the cinema and place them in a cultural and media context. The program encourages 
students to reflect methodologically and work on their own questions and topics. Parallel to this there are more 
practice-oriented offerings designed to give an insight into aspects of the culture and politics of film. In combination 
with a major from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, the minor in Film Sciences helps students develop the 
technical skills to analyze visual and acoustic phenomena within the framework of their studies in other areas of 
culture and the arts.

Major 90 Gender Studies
Description:
General description: 
Gender Studies encompasses women’s, men’s and gender studies, plus queer theory. It looks into the significance 
of gender and gender difference on an historically-founded, comparative cultural, and theoretically reflective basis, 
inquiring into the relationship between biological, physiological, psychological, and sociocultural differentiation on 
the one hand and processes involved in the social construction of gender and the renegotiation of gender 
boundaries on the other. At UZH the areas of thematic focus are literature and culture, non-European societies, 
transregional and postcolonial studies. A knowledge of gender and critical reflection on gender and gender 
relations are key to an understanding of increasingly complex societies. Those completing the program have a solid 
technical grounding in the discipline equipping them to do independent academic work in the field of gender 
research.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Innerhalb von Forschung und Wissenschaft eröffnen Gender Studies innovative Forschungsperspektiven und 
Tätigkeitsfelder. Darüber hinaus sind die im Studium vermittelten Fachkompetenzen in zahlreichen Praxis-
Bereichen einsetzbar: in öffentlichen und politischen Organisationen, in Unternehmen und Bildungseinrichtungen, 
in Nicht-Regierungs-Organisationen, Medien- und Kulturinstitutionen, Gleichstellungs-, Beratungs-, Sozial- und

Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program have optionally systematically acquired deeper knowledge in various areas of 
language and linguistics. They have a broader knowledge of areas including literary theory and history, methods of 
textual and cultural analysis, and Italo-Romance varieties from Latin to the present day. They are able to apply the

Career Prospects: 
Il Master in Linguistica e Letteratura Italiana del Romanisches Seminar offre stimolanti prospettive di carriera. Oltre 
alle numerose professioni nel settore terziario (economia; turismo; editoria; media; istituzioni culturali tra cui 
biblioteche, archivi e musei; organizzazioni internazionali; gestione delle risorse umane; professioni nel campo 
delle arti e in agenzie di comunicazione e uffici stampa; mediazione linguistica e culturale; ecc.) alle quali le 
competenze sono trasferibili, il percorso di studi permette alle studentesse e agli studenti di portare a compimento 
la formazione per docenti liceali, a Zurigo (Lehrdiplom für Maturitätsschulen per l’italiano come prima materia di 
insegnamento), in Ticino (Diploma di insegnamento per le scuole di maturità e Master of Arts SUPSI in 
Insegnamento per il livello secondario I) o altrove. Gli stage curricolari (Praktika) ti forniranno non solo una prima 
panoramica generale sulle differenti possibilità lavorative, ma ti permetteranno di acquisire in maniera stimolante 
nuove competenze spendibili nel mondo del lavoro. 
Se invece ti interessa la ricerca e desideri proseguire gli studi anche dopo aver ottenuto il tuo Master, puoi 
intraprendere una formazione dottorale iscrivendoti a un Dottorato di ricerca, che costituisce il più alto livello di 
istruzione universitaria. Fin dal Master hai la possibilità di muovere i primi passi nel mondo della ricerca 
partecipando attivamente a convegni, seminari e workshop, e assistendo a numerose manifestazioni scientifiche 
organizzate dalle cattedre di italianistica.

Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: English
Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich fünf Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Softwareentwicklung im Bereich Sprachtechnologie (IT-Firmen): Im 
Tätigkeitsfeld Softwareentwicklung plant und entwickelt man sprachtechnologische Software. 
Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, die Anforderungen zu analysieren, IT-Lösungen zu entwickeln und 
Systeme zu programmieren. Die konkreten Aufgaben hängen dabei vom jeweiligen Anwendungsgebiet ab. 
(2) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, 
Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert 
man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, 
Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich 
Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von Medienberichten, automatische 
Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme 
und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, Kundenanfragen etc.) sind 
Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(3) Terminologie und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(4) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder der Behörde beinhalten. Die Aufgabe 
besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten und zu 
vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte sind in 
bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. Consulting 
umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der Risiken beim 
Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie. 
(5) Wissenschaft und Forschung: Im Bereich Computerlinguistik und Sprachtechnologie kann sowohl 
Grundlagenforschung wie auch angewandte Forschung betrieben werden. Universitäre Hochschulen bieten 
meistens beide Möglichkeiten, während in der Industrie und an den Fachhochschulen v.a. angewandte Forschung 
stattfindet. Die konkreten Themen sind hier sehr vielfältig und abhängig von der jeweiligen Institution und 
Forschungsstelle.

man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, 
Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich 
Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von Medienberichten, automatische 
Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme 
und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, Kundenanfragen etc.) sind 
Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(3) Terminologie- und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(4) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder der Behörde beinhalten. Die Aufgabe 
besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten und zu 
vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte sind in 
bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. Consulting 
umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der Risiken beim 
Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie. 
(5) Wissenschaft und Forschung: Im Bereich Computerlinguistik und Sprachtechnologie kann sowohl 
Grundlagenforschung wie auch angewandte Forschung betrieben werden. Universitäre Hochschulen bieten 
meistens beide Möglichkeiten, während in der Industrie und an den Fachhochschulen v.a. angewandte Forschung 
stattfindet. Die konkreten Themen sind hier sehr vielfältig und abhängig von der jeweiligen Institution und 
Forschungsstelle.

Major 90 Greek Philology
Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program have a deeper knowledge of Greek language and literature in all its breadth, from 
Homer and the classical period to late antiquity, influenced by the emergence of Christianity. They can deal with 
confidence with very demanding original texts in a variety of genres. In their interpretations they draw on both 
traditional (e.g. textual philology) and modern approaches to literary, cultural, and linguistic interpretation. They also 
have the ability to recognize and assess intercultural relationships. In their Master’s thesis they have shown that 
they can do independent scholarly work and complete a complex task to a deadline. In general they have 
consolidated the basic attitudes acquired at Bachelor’s level (such as intellectual curiosity, old-fashioned creative 
thinking, etc.), preparing them for a variety of careers and professions both inside and outside the university.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German

Der Masterabschluss in Griechischer Philologie ist die Qualifikation für die Ausübung wissenschaftlicher Tätigkeit in 
Forschung und Lehre und bildet auch die fachwissenschaftliche Voraussetzung für das Lehrdiplom für 
Maturitätsschulen, wobei für das 1. Unterrichtsfach ein Major und für das 2. ein Minor verlangt wird. Wegen des 
Erwerbs überfachlicher Kompetenzen (wie Genauigkeit, Ausdauer und Selbstständigkeit) eröffnen sich weitere 
Tätigkeitsbereiche wie Bibliotheken, Archive, Verlage, öffentliche Verwaltung, Museen und andere kulturelle 
Institutionen, Banken, Versicherungen, Journalismus, Verlagswesen, Kulturmanagement und Medienarbeit im 
weiteren Sinne, internationale Organisationen, Tourismus, Diplomatie.

Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program have a basic knowledge of the language and are familiar with different registers of 
Latin. They can apply the relevant tools of Medieval Latin philology with confidence. They have improved their 
reading skills on the basis of primary texts. They have familiarized themselves with methods of transmission and 
textual criticism and different approaches to literary and cultural interpretation. They can present complex issues on 
their own and communicate their own research opinions persuasively. They are practiced in presenting their own

Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Die Berufsperspektiven dieses Minors hängen wesentlich vom gewählten Major-Studienprogramm ab. Die 
Kompetenzen, lateinische Texte des Mittelalters zu verstehen und mit mittelalterlichen Handschriften umzugehen, 
sind häufig eine notwendige Ergänzung für historische arbeitende Fächer wie die Geschichte, Germanistik, 
Kunstgeschichte, Romanistik und Anglistik. Für Latinisten bedeutet die Mittellateinische Philologie eine wichtige 
Erweiterung, die auch neue Möglichkeiten für den Unterricht eröffnet. Neben Lehre und/oder Forschung sind als 
Tätigkeitsfelder insbesondere Bibliotheken, Archive, Verlage, öffentliche Verwaltung, Museen und andere kulturelle 
Institutionen, Journalismus, Kulturmanagement und Medienarbeit im weiteren Sinne zu nennen. Diese 
verschiedenen Berufe früherer Absolventinnen und Absolventen erklären sich dadurch, dass überfachliche 
Kompetenzen wie Genauigkeit, Ausdauer und Selbstständigkeit erworben werden, die in allen möglichen 
Tätigkeitsbereichen hilfreich sind.

General description: 
The Master’s study program in History involves a thorough examination of history from antiquity to the most recent 
past. It places the emphasis on historical research, provides a deeper knowledge of theories and methods, and 
encourages students to engage intensively with a specific topic without limiting their broad historical knowledge or 
their professional or academic prospects. Those completing the program acquire the ability to work on their own 
ambitious topics and critically discuss methodological and theoretical concepts. They learn to think in terms of 
complex historical contexts and present them in a structured manner. The study program provides a high-level 
academic training. A Master’s degree enables students to develop their own individual profile and qualifies them for 
ambitious professional challenges. It is also a prerequisite for those wishing to continue their academic career at 
doctoral level.

Minor 30 Digital Linguistics
Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program are familiar with methods of linguistic data acquisition and have acquired knowledge 
in the automatic processing and analysis of large corpora and databases. They have programming skills and have 
deepened their knowledge in topics of their own choice, such as machine learning, machine translation, text 
mining, the semantic web, and parsing. They are able to read research papers on linguistics and language 
technology and apply the latest methods to large collections of linguistic data.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: English
Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich drei Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, 
Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -
analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. 
Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen 
aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von 
Medienberichten, automatische Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. 
Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, 
Kundenanfragen etc.) sind Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(2) Terminologie und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(3) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder der Behörde beinhalten. Die Aufgabe 
besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten und zu 
vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte sind in 
bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. Consulting 
umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der Risiken beim 
Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie.

Minor 60 Ancient Studies
Description:
General description: 
This interdisciplinary study program is an exemplary introduction to the multifaceted world of culture in 
Mediterranean antiquity, which still resonates powerfully today. Those completing the program are familiar with the 
most important scholarly methods and tools (including digital tools). They have specialized in two of the four areas 
of antiquity – literatures and their languages, material cultures, historical events and developments, religions and 
philosophical traditions – and have built a relevant portfolio of languages. 
They can analyze scientific data independently and critically question research opinions. They are practiced in 
presenting complex issues appropriately for the audience in question. In general they have adopted intellectual 
curiosity, stamina, meticulous accuracy and the courage to indulge in old-fashioned creative thinking as 
fundamental attitudes, and have acquired intercultural skills by comparing antiquity and modernity.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Die Berufsperspektiven dieses Minors hängen wesentlich vom gewählten Major-Studienprogramm ab. In der Regel 
schliesst sich an den Bachelor in Altertumswissenschaften ein Master im gleichen Bereich an, also ein Minor-
Studienprogramm im Umfang von 30 oder ein Mono-Studienprogramm im Umfang von 120 ECTS Credits. Bereits 
der Bachelor-Abschluss qualifiziert jedoch für Tätigkeiten in den verschiedensten Bereichen, darunter im Bildungs- 
und Bibliothekswesen sowie im Kultursektor, in der öffentlichen Verwaltung und im Journalismus. Er eröffnet 
Zugänge zu Spezialausbildungen und Aufbaustudien, über die sich ein breites Feld weiterer beruflicher Tätigkeiten 
erschliesst.

Single Major 120 Ancient Studies
Description:
General description: 
The study program addresses the entire ancient world of the Mediterranean on a cross-disciplinary basis, from its 
beginnings in the orient via Greece and Rome to late antiquity, influenced by the emergence of Christianity. Those 
completing the program have consolidated scholarly know-how in three of the four areas of antiquity – literatures 
and their languages, material cultures, historical events and developments, religions and philosophical traditions. 
This knowledge equips them to create and work on individual projects and present them appropriately for the 
audience in question. In their Master’s thesis they have shown that they can do independent scholarly work and 
complete a complex task to a deadline. In general they have consolidated the basic attitudes they endeavored to 
develop at Bachelor’s level (such as intellectual curiosity, intercultural competence, etc.), preparing them for a 
variety of careers and professions both inside and outside the university.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Ein Master-Abschluss in Altertumswissenschaften ist die Qualifikation für die Ausübung wissenschaftlicher Tätigkeit 
in Forschung und Lehre auf dem Gebiet der griechischen und lateinischen Antike. Mit dem Abschluss des Mono-
Studienprogramms (inkl. Masterarbeit und mind. 45 ECTS Credits in Lateinischer Philologie) und entsprechender 
Bachelor-Vorbildung ist eine Zulassung zum Lehrdiplom für Maturitätsschulen möglich. Daneben qualifiziert der 
Abschluss für Tätigkeiten in den verschiedensten Bereichen, darunter im Bildungs- und Bibliothekswesen sowie im 
Kultursektor, in der öffentlichen Verwaltung und im Journalismus. Er eröffnet Zugänge zu Spezialausbildungen und 
Aufbaustudien, über die sich ein breites Feld weiterer beruflicher Tätigkeiten erschliesst.

Minor 30 Ancient Studies
Description:
General description: 
The study program fosters an interdisciplinary approach to the ancient world of 
the Mediterranean in more depth. Those completing the program have consolidated 
scholarly know-how in two of the four areas of antiquity – literatures and their 
languages, material cultures, historical events and developments, religions and 
philosophical traditions. They have learned to handle the relevant tools with 
confidence, and at the same time have further built their language portfolio. 
They are familiar with the history of ancient and classical studies and the 
most important trends in contemporary research. They have experience in leading 
discussions and in scholarly argument, and in communicating complex issues. In 
general they have consolidated the attitudes they endeavored to develop at 
Bachelor’s level (such as intellectual curiosity, intercultural competence, 
etc.), preparing them for a variety of careers and professions both inside and 
outside the university.

Minor 30 Economic History
Description:
General description: 
Historians and economists use different models and terminologies to explain economic developments, and 
business and economic policy decisions. The interdisciplinary study program removes these barriers to 
understanding to build a productive relationship of cooperation between the two disciplines. 
Economists learn about the significance of historical factors, while historians gain familiarity with the argumentation 
and research contexts of economics. The study program is cross-epochal, cross-faculty, and interdisciplinary. It 
combines quantitative and qualitative methods and brings different topics together.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
Das Studienprogramm eröffnet ein breites Tätigkeitsfeld in Forschung und Lehre, Grossunternehmen und KMUs. 
Darüber hinaus qualifiziert es für Führungsfunktionen in Unternehmen, Stiftungen, Berufsverbänden und

sozialer Faktoren voraussetzen.

Major 90 Art History in a Global Context
Description:
General description: 
The major in Art History in a Global Context takes a global, cultural geographic teaching approach to artworks in 
East Asia, North America, and Europe. A supplementary offering covers the history of art in other culture areas. 
The study program is designed to allow the considered, critical methodological examination of historical and current 
phenomena such as transculturality, national identity, the history of style, postcolonialism, the geography of art, 
human mobility, migration, and cultural transfer. Those with a Master’s degree in Art History in a Global Context are 
qualified to work in an internationally-oriented academic career, in the global art market in its entire breadth, in 
museums of art and cultural history, and in art criticism and art education.

Major 90 Social Anthropology
Description:
General description: 
Social anthropology focuses on human cultures and societies. It studies the ecological, economic, political, legal, 
social, and cultural dimensions of human sociality in its diversity and historical development. It 
place the emphasis on the empirical, comparative, and theoretically reflective 
analysis of a wide range of topics, for example everyday practice, social and 
religious movements, conflicts, and development organizations. Master's students do a research-based degree. 
Research is done either in Switzerland or 
abroad, in an ethnographic museum or on the basis of literature. Those completing the program further develop 
their ability to work scientifically, 
deepen their knowledge of the theories and methods of social anthropology, and familiarize themselves with the 
ethnography of a particular 
region of the world. They learn to quickly understand new contexts and grasp 
their systematic character, and are able to act competently under complex 
conditions.

Major 120 Study of Religions
Description:
General description: 
The Bachelor's degree program in Religious Studies as a major program of study is designed as a wide-ranging 
scholarly introduction to the historical and contemporary relationships between religion, culture, and society. The 
core curriculum for this program at the University of Zurich is divided into three pillars that complement one another 
in terms of methodology and subject matter. 
These pillars involve the study of religions from a historical-comparative, social science, and systematic-theoretical 
perspective. Here, basic courses impart knowledge of various religious traditions, while language courses allow for 
an in-depth study of individual sources and traditions. Finally, methodology courses teach students various 
techniques for collecting and analyzing data. Lectures and seminars address the transformation of the meaning 
and function of religion throughout history and in the present day. The historical dynamics of religious history, 
alternative forms of religion, and the interaction between religion and society are systematically covered as well. 
The Bachelor's degree program in Religious Studies as a major program of study can be combined with a minor 
program of study offered by the Faculty of Theology or another faculty.

Admission Requirements: 
Bachelor’s degree with a specialization in theology or religious studies as at least a minor program of study with 60 
ECTS credits. Admission with restrictions may be granted to applicants who have the required specialization but 
who do not display sufficient knowledge of the subject. Applicants who do not possess a Bachelor’s degree with the

minor program of study, or a Bachelor's degree in Religious Studies as a major or minor program of study 
(provided proficiency in two relevant source text languages can be proved), or a Bachelor's degree in Theology as 
a major or single major from the Faculty of Theology at the University of Zurich, or if the applicant has an equivalent 
or higher-quality degree from a university in Switzerland or abroad, provided the degree is recognized by the 
Faculty of Theology. Admission to the consecutive Master’s degree program in History of Ancient Religions as a 
minor program of study requires the applicant to have knowledge of two of the languages relevant to the selected 
area of concentration, whereby 12 ECTS credits need to have been earned for each language. Applicants must

normally a Master’s degree.
Further Study Options: 
The Major degree in Biomedicine at the Bachelor’s level (Major Study Program worth 150 ECTS Credits) entitles to 
enrol for the Major Study Programs in Biomedicine at the Master’s level with no further conditions. The admission 
to related Master Programs (biology, biochemistry) is possible. For these programs, however, the formal enrolment 
may depend on the fulfilment of additional requirements or conditions. The admission to specialized Master 
programs (e.g. biostatistics) an application is necessary.

Organization:
Program Structure: The compulsory modules (110 ECTS) of the basic studies (1st-4th semester) cover the 
natural sciences (chemistry, physics, biochemistry), the basic and applied 
mathematics (analysis, statistics, programming, data analysis), the relevant biological 
subjects (molecular genetics, cell biology, evolution and developmental biology of 
humans, microbiology, neurobiology) and the medical subjects (anatomy, physiology, 
pathophysiology, immunology, virology). In the elective modules (40 ECTS) of the 
advanced studies (5th and 6th semester), knowledge of molecular and cellular 
mechanisms of important human diseases is acquired, as well as biomedical research 
methods for their diagnosis, therapy and prevention. The main part of the 3rd year of 
study is formed by practical courses in research courses of the Faculty (e.g. in the 
Institutes of Physiology, Medical Virology, Experimental Immunology, Molecular 
Cancer Research, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Molecular Life Sciences, Anatomy, 
quantitative biomedicine, etc.) and in various University hospitals in Zurich. 
There, students get the possibility to find their thematic priority within biomedicine or to 
choose a program within the Biology Master.
Major/Minor-Combinations: The Major Study Program in Biomedicine worth 150 ECTS Credits can be combined 
with a Minor Study Program worth 30 ECTS credits. Minor Study Programs can be 
chosen from the entire range of subjects offered by the University of Zurich. A Minor 
Study Program starts in the second year of study. In the second year of study, all 
elective modules are replaced with modules of the Minor Study Program (10 ECTS), in 
the third year a part of elective modules are replaced with modules of the Minor Study 
Program (20 ECTS). 
Part-Time Studies: Part-time studies are well possible due to the modular structure of the basic study 
period. However, the duration of studies will be extended and it must be noted that the 
sequence of compulsory modules of the basic study period is constructive. The third 
regular year of studies for the Bachelor's degree (advanced studies) contains block 
courses and lectures that take up the whole working week. Part-time students thus 
have to organize their time in advanced studies to ensure their presence in coherent 
time blocks of at least three and a half weeks. If necessary, the study counselling 
service can be contacted.

Medicine. Following completion of the Bachelor’s degree program, students of Veterinary Medicine generally study 
toward a Master’s degree in the field.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in the same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Where the subject is changed, the faculty can require proof of additional competences beyond 
those acquired in the Bachelor's program. This is also applicable to acceptance onto specialized Master's courses. 
In any event, even when the Master's course is in the same subject, the faculty can make the completion of a 
Master's degree dependent on the fulfillment of additional requirements. These requirements can also be fulfilled 
during the Master's course. The details are set out in the framework rules and the study rules.

General description: 
The degree program Teaching Diploma for Upper Secondary Education in one subject is a teaching qualification 
that supplements an individual's subject-specific Master's degree. The program is designed to impart pedagogical 
and methodological skills and is structured into three areas: education studies, subject-specific teaching, and 
teaching practice. During their studies, participants acquire the ability to plan, design, and evaluate lessons that 
challenge learners and that are geared to their cognitive level. Upon completing the program, graduates have 
acquired sound theoretical knowledge as well as professional skills and competencies, thus qualifying them to 
teach their subject at upper secondary schools (baccalaureate schools, specialized schools, and – with the 
necessary additional qualification – vocational baccalaureate schools). They are furthermore able to help their 
students achieve a university entrance qualification and to foster their ability to think independently and act 
responsibly.

General description: 
The degree program Teaching Diploma for Upper Secondary Education in two subjects is a teaching qualification 
that supplements an individual's subject-specific Master's degree. The program is designed to impart pedagogical 
and methodological skills and is structured into three areas: education studies, subject-specific teaching, and 
teaching practice. During their studies, participants acquire the ability to plan, design, and evaluate lessons that 
challenge learners and that are geared to their cognitive level. Upon completing the program, graduates have 
acquired sound theoretical knowledge as well as professional skills and competencies, thus qualifying them to 
teach their subjects at upper secondary schools (baccalaureate schools, specialized schools, and – with the 
necessary additional qualification – vocational baccalaureate schools). They are furthermore able to help their 
students achieve a university entrance qualification and to foster their ability to think independently and act 
responsibly.

Teaching Subject 2 Chemistry (2nd Teaching Subject)
Description:
General description: 
The degree program Teaching Diploma for Upper Secondary Education in two subjects is a teaching qualification 
that supplements an individual's subject-specific Master's degree. The program is designed to impart pedagogical 
and methodological skills and is structured into three areas: education studies, subject-specific teaching, and 
teaching practice. During their studies, participants acquire the ability to plan, design, and evaluate lessons that 
challenge learners and that are geared to their cognitive level. Upon completing the program, graduates have 
acquired sound theoretical knowledge as well as professional skills and competencies, thus qualifying them to 
teach their subjects at upper secondary schools (baccalaureate schools, specialized schools, and – with the 
necessary additional qualification – vocational baccalaureate schools). They are furthermore able to help their 
students achieve a university entrance qualification and to foster their ability to think independently and act 
responsibly.

met prior to admission to doctoral 
study; restrictions may be fulfilled during doctoral study. Coursework required 
to meet conditions and/or restrictions may not exceed a total of 60 ECTS credits; requirements are specified 
according to the demands of the subject in 
which the PhD thesis will be written. The Vice Dean of Studies decides on 
admission, on recognition of similar degrees, and on conditions and/or additional requirements that may apply. As a 
rule, the language of instruction 
in the PhD programs is English. All applicants whose native language is not 
English, or whose prior studies have not been conducted in English, are required to provide proof of sufficient 
knowledge of English.

Single Major 90 Computational Science (specialized Master)
Description:
General description: 
The specialized single major study program in Computational Science (90 ECTS credits) at Master’s level provides 
students with in-depth techniques in computational and simulation science. The increasing power of computers has 
made calculations possible that were unthinkable a decade ago. The high level of complexity of scientific problems 
and industrial modeling can today be surmounted by modern computers and novel computational methods. These 
skills can now be considered as part of the technical foundation of scientists. The program provides students with 
the necessary skills and knowledge in computational sciences to conduct independent scientific research. Students 
are required to attend compulsory courses and seminars worth 15-25 ECTS credits. 35-40 ECTS credits are 
earned in elective modules. The compulsory master's thesis (30 ECTS credits) and master's examination complete 
the education.
Program Outcomes: 
Graduates of the spec. master's program acquire the following knowledge: 
 
- Methodological foundations for simulation in the natural sciences. 
 
- Numerical methods for differential equations in simulations 
 
- Advanced high-performance computing 
 
- Methods for visualization of simulation data 
 
- Machine learning in the sciences 
Additional learning objectives (elective modules) relate to the different application areas: 
 
- Computational Physics and Astrophysics 
 
- Computational chemistry 
 
- Computer Graphics 
 
- Applications in Earth and Environmental sciences 
Languages of Instruction: English
Career Prospects: 
Graduates are well prepared for careers in academia or scientifically oriented industry. The program is inherently 
interdisciplinary, allowing students to work across boundaries in a dynamic environment and learn a wide range of 
numerical methods and their application in various fields. 
Doctoral studies in one of several disciplines is another obvious option.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Master's degree entitles the student to continue studying at the doctoral level. The faculty can make 
admission to a Doctorate course dependent on further conditions. The details are set out in the corresponding rules 
for Doctorates.
Requirements:
Admission Requirements: 
The specialized mono/major study program Computational Science (90 ECTS credits) at Master's level requires 
one of the three UZH minor study programs Computational Science 60, Data Analysis in Natural Sciences, 
Simulations in Natural Sciences 30 or at least 30 ECTS credits from applied mathematics and programming 
modules during the bachelor's degree. 
Graduates of Universities of Applied Sciences from Switzerland may be considered with additional requirements. 
Page 2,689 of 3,049
The overall qualification is evaluated by the admission committee.

Major/Minor-Combinations: The specialized Master study programm in Computational Science 90 can be taken as 
a single major or be combined with a minor 30.
Part-Time Studies: Das Teilzeitstudium ist aufgrund des modularen Aufbaus gut möglich. Die 
Studiendauer wird sich dadurch allerdings ausdehnen. Ein konkretes individuelles 
Modell für ein Teilzeitstudium sollte vorgängig mit dem Studienberater abgesprochen 
werden.

Admission Requirements: 
Admission to doctoral study is governed by the ordinance on admission to studies at the University of Zurich 
(Verordnung über die Zulassung an der 
Universität Zürich VZS). The main requirement for admission to doctoral study 
is a Master's degree from a university or an equivalent degree. Each PhD project must receive approval from a 
professor at the Faculty of Science or 
from a person who has the right to confer a PhD at the Faculty of Science. 
There is no general right to be granted admission to a PhD program. 
Admission 
may be made contingent on conditions and/or restrictions in the form of additional coursework. Conditions must be 
met prior to admission to doctoral 
study; restrictions may be fulfilled during doctoral study. Coursework required 
to meet conditions and/or restrictions may not exceed a total of 60 ECTS credits; requirements are specified 
according to the demands of the subject in 
which the PhD thesis will be written. The Vice Dean of Studies decides on 
admission, on recognition of similar degrees, and on conditions and/or additional requirements that may apply. As a 
rule, the language of instruction 
in the PhD programs is English. All applicants whose native language is not 
English, or whose prior studies have not been conducted in English, are required to provide proof of sufficient 
knowledge of English.
Particulars/Requirements: 
A joint doctorate at the Faculty of Science of the UZH and the ETH Zurich is only open to applicants whose 
responsible professor, with the right to confer a PhD at the Faculty of Science, has a double professorship at the 
UZH and at the ETHZ.

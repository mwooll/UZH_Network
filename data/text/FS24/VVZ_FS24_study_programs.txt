Minor 30 Hermeneutics
Description:
General description: 
The Bachelor's Degree minor in Hermeneutics introduces the most important questions about the theory of 
interpretation and understanding. It also offers a survey of the main phases in the development of the discipline 
and present contemporary viewpoints and debates. Methods of interpretation are considered critically in relation to 
their presuppositions and implications. This minor can well be taken in combination with other fields of study 
involving interpretation (theology, study of religions, philosophy, literature studies, history, jurisprudence, social 
sciences and others). For this reason, interdisciplinary connections of this kind are a consciously planned part of 
the program.
Program Outcomes: 
See description of the degree program 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
See major subject degree program for theology
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in the same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Where the subject is changed, the faculty can require proof of additional competences beyond 
those acquired in the Bachelor's program. This is also applicable to acceptance onto specialized Master's courses. 
In any event, even when the Master's course is in the same subject, the faculty can make the completion of a 
Master's degree dependent on the fulfillment of additional requirements. These requirements can also be fulfilled 
during the Master's course. The details are set out in the framework rules and the study rules.
Requirements:
Admission Requirements: 
The provisions laid out in the framework ordinance for Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programs at the Faculty of 
Arts and Social Sciences, University of Zurich, and the provisions defined in the pertinent program regulations 
apply, see http://www.phil.uzh.ch/studium.html (in German).
Particulars/Requirements:

Application Deadline: 
Grading: The student's achievement is assessed at the end of each module. 
Achievements are graded on a scale from 1 to 6, whereby 6 denotes the highest grade 
of achievement and 1 the lowest. Half-grades are permitted. A grade below 
4 is insufficient. 
Achievements can also be graded with 'passed' or 'failed'.

Part-Time Studies: The duration of a degree course is longer for part-time students. 
 
The degree course can be prolonged, without reasons, to six years for a Bachelor's 
degree and to four years for a Master's degree. The maximum duration of study for 
Bachelor's and Master's degrees is thus double the standard period of studies, 
calculated from the start of the relevant degree.

Description:
General description: 
The Bachelor's Degree minor in Church History introduces the historical development of Christianity, churches, 
religious life and the assertions of Christian theology and faith. It gives insight into basic themes of church history 
through every era and teaches a methodological approach to historical material. Like other historical disciplines it 
engenders view points and a sense of orientation with regard to contemporary questions relating to the church and 
the world. This track presupposes a knowledge of Latin, which must otherwise be learned. Learning Greek is also a 
possible option.

Single Major 120 Religion – Economics – Politics
Description:
General description: 
The Master's degree program Religion – Economics – Politics is designed to link the methodological knowledge 
gained in a Bachelor's degree program in one field of study (Theology, Religious Studies, Economics and Business

Students learn to deal with complex questions that arise at the intersection of religion and economics/religion and 
politics. Students are then required to demonstrate their abilities in a Master's dissertation. The joint degree 
Master's program is an interdisciplinary academic program designed to enable graduates to independently 
recognize and to coherently analyze and assess the interrelationship between religion, economics and politics.
Program Outcomes: 
The interdisciplinary education provided by the Joint Degree Master's program will equip students with the ability to 
independently identify, analyze and evaluate the relationship between religion, economy and politics in a focused 
way. As a result students will be ideally placed to address the challenges posed by a global economy and society, 
cross-border politics and increasing religious and cultural diversity, and to take an active role in dealing with the 
issues that arise.

Single Major 180 Biology
Description:
General description: 
The single major study program in Biology (180 ECTS credits) provides students with a general education in 
Natural Sciences, knowledge in all research areas of Biology and the capability to think and work methodically and 
scientifically. Course components: In the compulsory modules (90 ECTS credits) of the basic studies curriculum, 
students learn important concepts in all biological disciplines, from the molecular level, through genes, cells, 
individuals, populations and up to ecosystems. At the same time students gain basic knowledge of Mathematics, 
Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry. Following their interests, students choose core elective modules (30 ECTS 
credits) of biology-related fields already during their basic studies. During the advanced studies curriculum (60 
ECTS credits) students develop their knowledge in areas of their choice in block courses and special lectures and 
in elective modules.
Program Outcomes: 
A bachelor major study program Biology taken for 150 or 120 ECTS imparts the same foundational knowledge on 
students as a single major study program (180 ECTS), but they differ in the breadth of knowledge that is taught. 
Both options teach students foundational theory and praxis in Biology as well as in other foundational subjects in 
the natural sciences. Students learn to think and work systematically and scientifically. 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
With a BSc in biology, graduates have the necessary theoretical and practical qualifications for the Master's degree 
course in one of the consecutive Master's concentrations in biology, and depending on the choice of optional core 
modules, for the Master's program in biomedicine, biochemistry and specialized Master programs such as 
biostatistics or environmental science. The first degree of BSc in biology is also suitable for a start in all types of 
training and education programs of private and public companies.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in the same subject without having to fulfill

Major/Minor-Combinations: A study program Biology 180 is a single major study program. A major study program 
Biology 120 can be combined with a minor study program 60. A major study program 
Biology 150 can be combined with a minor study program 30. Minor study programs 
can be chosen from the entire range of subjects offered by the University of Zurich. A 
minor study program starts in the second year of study.
Part-Time Studies: The basic studies of the Bachelor's degree program in biology are particularly suitable 
for part-time studies. This naturally leads though to a prolonged period of studies. The 
order of the compulsory modules during basic studies in the regular degree program is 
not binding. If basic studies are completed in 6 or 8 instead of 4 semesters you should 
nevertheless try to complete the mathematics before the physics and the chemistry 
before the biochemistry elements. The third regular year of studies for the Bachelor's 
degree (advanced studies) contains block courses and lectures that take up the whole 
working week. Part-time students thus have to organize their time in advanced studies 
to ensure their presence in coherent time blocks of at least three and a half weeks.

knowledge in scientific, biological and medical subjects as well as in biostatistics and bioinformatics in the solution 
of biomedical questions in theory and practice and to recognize, describe and explain biomedical concepts and 
phenomena. 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
A permanent professional position is hardly possible with a Bachelor’s degree, at best it is only possible to do an 
internship or to enter a training program in private or public companies. The prerequisite for employment is 
normally a Master’s degree.
Further Study Options: 
The Single Major degree in Biomedicine at the Bachelor’s level (Major Study Program worth 180 ECTS Credits) 
entitles to enrol for the Major Study Programs in Biomedicine at the Master’s level with no further conditions. The

Program Structure: The compulsory modules (113 ECTS) and elective modules (7 ECTS) of the basic 
studies (1st-4th semester) cover the natural sciences (chemistry, physics, 
biochemistry), the basic and applied mathematics (analysis, statistics, programming, 
data analysis), the relevant biological subjects (molecular genetics, cell biology, 
evolution and developmental biology of humans, microbiology, neurobiology, systems 
biology) and the medical subjects (anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, 
immunology, virology, histology). In the elective modules (60 ECTS) of the advanced 
studies (5th and 6th semester), knowledge of molecular and cellular mechanisms of 
important human diseases is acquired, as well as biomedical research methods for 
their diagnosis, therapy and prevention. The main part of the 3rd year of study is 
formed by practical courses in research courses of the Faculty (e.g. in the Institutes of 
Physiology, Medical Virology, Experimental Immunology, Molecular Cancer Research, 
Pharmacology and Toxicology, Molecular Life Sciences, Anatomy, Quantitative 
Biomedicine, etc.) and in various University hospitals in Zurich. 
There, students get the possibility to find their thematic priority within biomedicine or to 
choose a program within the Biology Master. 
Major/Minor-Combinations: The Bachelor's study program Biomedicine 180 is a single major study program. No 
minor studs program can be taken.
Part-Time Studies: Part-time studies are well possible due to the modular structure of the basic study 
period. However, the duration of studies will be extended and it must be noted that the 
sequence of compulsory modules of the basic study period is constructive. The third 
regular year of studies for the Bachelor's degree (advanced studies) contains block 
courses and lectures that take up the whole working week. Part-time students thus 
have to organize their time in advanced studies to ensure their presence in coherent 
time blocks of at least three and a half weeks. If necessary, the study counselling 
service can be contacted.

understanding further. First experiences in independent research work are gained during the Bachelor’s thesis (10 
ECTS credits).
Program Outcomes: 
A bachelor’s major study program in Chemistry taken for 150 or 120 ECTS imparts the same foundational 
knowledge on students as a single major study program (180 ECTS), but they differ in the breadth of knowledge 
that is taught. Both options teach students foundational theory and praxis in Chemistry as well as in other 
foundational subjects in the natural sciences. Students learn to think and work systematically and scientifically and 
acquire the subject-specific qualifications necessary to teach Chemistry as their second teaching subject at Upper 
Secondary Schools (Sekundarstufe II). 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
The Bachelor’s degree is a suitable qualification for entry into a career requiring a general scientific degree. 
 
Our world needs experts in chemistry across the entire range of human endeavor. Chemistry is the driving force for 
finance and the market, it has an influence on health and the environment, and makes significant contributions to 
the development of art and entertainment.
Further Study Options: 
Successful completion of the BSc entitles students to continue studying the same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Should a student wish to change his or her field of study, the faculty may demand evidence of

Major 150 Biology
Description:
General description: 
The major study program in Biology (150 ECTS credits) provides students with a general education in Natural 
Sciences, knowledge in all research areas of Biology and the capability to think and work methodically and 
scientifically. 
Course components: In the compulsory modules (90 ECTS credits) of the basic studies curriculum, students learn 
important concepts in all biological disciplines, from the molecular level, through genes, cells, individuals, 
populations and up to ecosystems. At the same time students gain basic knowledge of Mathematics, Physics, 
Chemistry and Biochemistry. Following their interests, students choose core elective modules (15 ECTS credits) of 
biology-related fields already during their basic studies. During the advanced studies curriculum (45 ECTS credits) 
students develop their knowledge in areas of their choice in block courses and special lectures.
Program Outcomes: 
A bachelor major study program Biology taken for 150 or 120 ECTS imparts the same foundational knowledge on 
students as a single major study program (180 ECTS), but they differ in the breadth of knowledge that is taught. 
Both options teach students foundational theory and praxis in Biology as well as in other foundational subjects in 
the natural sciences. Students learn to think and work systematically and scientifically. 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
With a BSc in biology, graduates have the necessary theoretical and practical qualifications for the Master's degree 
course in one of the consecutive Master's concentrations in biology, and depending on the choice of optional core 
modules, for the Master's program in biomedicine, biochemistry and specialized Master programs such as 
biostatistics or environmental science. The first degree of BSc in biology is also suitable for a start in all types of 
training and education programs of private and public companies.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in the same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Where the subject is changed, the faculty can require proof of additional competences. This is 
also applicable to acceptance onto specialized Master's programs.

Part-Time Studies: The basic studies of the Bachelor's degree program in biology are particularly suitable 
for part-time studies. This naturally leads though to a prolonged period of studies. The 
order of the compulsory modules during basic studies in the regular degree program is 
bottom-up. The third regular year of studies for the Bachelor's degree (advanced 
studies) contains block courses and lectures that take up the whole working week. 
Part-time students thus have to organize their time in advanced studies to ensure their 
presence in coherent time blocks of at least three and a half weeks. The instrument for 
planning individual programs of studies is the guideline on studying biology at the

scientists in information technology as well as engineering and natural sciences.
Further Study Options: 
The Bachelor degree can be followed by master’s studies. The Bachelor degree should not be understood so much 
as a professional qualification; there has as yet been no specific demand for a Bachelor in Mathematics on the part 
of business. Rather it is seen as a bridge to Master studies or acts a mobility hinge to begin a Masters academic 
program at a different university or in different subject areas.

minor study program starts in the second year of study. 
Part-Time Studies: The basic studies of the Bachelor's degree program in biology are particularly suitable 
for part-time studies. This naturally leads though to a prolonged period of studies. The 
order of the compulsory modules during basic studies in the regular degree program is 
bottom-up. The third regular year of studies for the Bachelor's degree (advanced 
studies) contains block courses and lectures that take up the whole working week. 
Part-time students thus have to organize their time in advanced studies to ensure their 
presence in coherent time blocks of at least three and a half weeks. The instrument for 
planning individual programs of studies is the guideline on studying biology at the

Major 120 Geography
Description:
General description: 
The major study program in Geography (120 ECTS credits) provides a general education in Geo sciences and 
covers all three thematic subject areas of Geography (Physical Geography, Human Geography and Geographic 
Information Science &amp; Remote Sensing) and builds the capability to think and work in a systematic and 
scientific way. The course is structured through ECTS credits: The first two years include compulsory modules in 
Geography, Earth Sciences and Mathematics. The third year includes a Bachelor's research project and further 
compulsory modules that consolidate knowledge gained over the thematic subject areas. Further ECTS credits 
must be gained from a wide range of optional modules, wherein individuals can choose to focus on a particular 
area.
Program Outcomes: 
The Bachelor's degree in Geography provides an understanding of basic concepts and current trends of 
development in the subject. It is characterized by a broad and fundamental education and offers opportunities for 
thematic consolidation in the final year of study. The subject combines approaches from the natural, social and 
computer sciences, thus offering a unique combination of research perspectives. In teaching, in-depth knowledge 
from current research projects is presented in order to critically examine socially relevant topics. 
Students’ intellectual abilities and networked thinking are encouraged to prepare them for their future educational 
path. 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
The Bachelor's degree is a prerequisite for a Master's degree at the University of Zurich (UZH) or at another 
university and does not constitute a professional qualification. A Master's degree in another major study program is 
generally possible with the Bachelor's degree in Geography, but may be subject to conditions and additional 
requirements depending on the study program. Graduates of the Department of Geography are in demand on the 
job market, due to their methodological-theoretical and application-oriented skills. The fields of employment are 
diverse (e.g. in the fields of spatial planning, environment, landscape and human beings, geoinformatics and 
communication or teaching at secondary schools) and usually depend on the thematic consolidation chosen in the 
Master's program. 
Further Study Options: 
Earning a Bachelor’s degree automatically qualifies students to continue studying the same subject without having 
to fulfill further conditions. Should students wish to change their field of study, the faculty may demand evidence of 
any skills not developed the Bachelor’s study program before granting acceptance to a Master’s study program. 
This also applies to entry to specialized Master’s study programs. 
In any event - even in the same field of study - the faculty may make the completion of the Master’s degree 
dependent upon meeting additional requirements. These requirements may also be fulfilled during the Master’s 
study program. Details are set out in the framework rules and study regulations.
Requirements:
Admission Requirements: 
The conditions for admission to the Bachelor’s degree programme are regulated in: „Verordnung über die 
Zulassung zum Studium an der Universität Zürich (VZS)".

Program Structure: The first two years of the study program mainly consist of compulsory modules in 
Geography, Earth Sciences and Mathematics. The third year of the study program 
comprises a Bachelor’s thesis as well as elective modules that allow initial 
specializations within the thematic areas (see above). The program is supplemented 
with further consolidation and elective modules in Geography and related disciplines. 
Within the elective area, individual thematic focuses can be set.
Major/Minor-Combinations: A study program in Geography 180 at Bachelor’s level is a single major study program. 
A major study program in Geography 120 at Bachelor’s level can be combined with a 
minor study program 60. A major study program in Geography 150 at Bachelor’s level 
can be combined with a minor study program 30. 
Minor study programs can be chosen from the entire range of subjects offered by the 
University of Zurich. Possible minor study programs at ETH Zurich are listed on the 
website of the Department of Geography. A minor study program starts in the second 
year of study. 
Part-Time Studies: Studying part-time is possible, but not recommended. However, the maximum period 
of 12 semesters (double the standard period of study) must not be exceeded. An exact 
planning of the part-time study is necessary and should take place in consultation with 
the Student Advisory Board.

Admission Requirements: 
Admission to doctoral study is governed by the ordinance on admission to studies at the University of Zurich 
(Verordnung über die Zulassung an der Universität Zürich VZS). The main requirement for admission to doctoral 
study is a Master's degree from a university or an equivalent degree. Each PhD project must receive approval from 
a professor at the Faculty of Science or from a person who has the right to confer a PhD at the Faculty of Science. 
There is no general right to be granted admission to a PhD program. Admission may be made contingent on 
conditions and/or restrictions in the form of additional coursework. Conditions must be met prior to admission to 
doctoral study; restrictions may be fulfilled during doctoral study. Coursework required to meet conditions and/or 
restrictions may not exceed a total of 60 ECTS credits; requirements are specified according to the demands of the 
subject in which the PhD thesis will be written. The Vice Dean of Studies decides on admission, on recognition of 
similar degrees, and on conditions and/or additional requirements that may apply. As a rule, the language of 
instruction in the PhD programs is English. All applicants whose native language is not English, or whose prior 
studies have not been conducted in English, are required to provide proof of sufficient knowledge of English.

Minor 30 Ethics
Description:
General description: 
The Ethics minor study program is offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences for Bachelor's students in the 
Faculty of Economics, Business Administration and Informatics, and the Faculty of Science. It gives insights into a 
coherent field of interrelated themes and disciplines, and allows students to choose their own area of focus. 
Ethics deals with moral, social, and political issues against the backdrop of an exploration of the methodological 
and technical fundamentals of moral theories. Among other things the program is designed to enable participants 
to acquire a basic knowledge of the methodology of practical philosophy, familiarity with the classical conception of 
moral and ethical argumentation, and the ability to methodically reflect on ethical issues, and discuss or work with 
them independently at a high level of rational discourse.
Program Outcomes: 
The goals of the program include the acquisition of knowledge of key concepts, problems, and theories in the field 
of ethics. Students gain insights into the history of western ideas and concepts, and become familiar with the 
distinctive nature of ethical issues and argumentation. They learn appropriate ways of talking and writing about 
philosophical texts and argumentation, and how to deploy specific tools and resources. The program is designed to 
promote enhanced analytical and reflective skills, keen methodological awareness, cultivated linguistic and 
argumentative skills, and hermeneutic competence. 
Students of ethics also learn how to critically question assumptions.

Minor 30 Cultural Contexts
Description:
General description: 
The Cultural Contexts minor study program is offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences for Bachelor's 
students in the Faculty of Economics, Business Administration and Informatics, and the Faculty of Science. It gives 
insights into a coherent field of interrelated themes and disciplines, and allows students to choose their own area of 
focus. 
Contextual cultural knowledge is vital in terms of enabling academic disciplines to position themselves historically 
and globally. This knowledge is acquired through an exploration of the temporally and geographically unfamiliar, as 
well as through closer investigation and analysis of the supposedly familiar. 
The study program is designed to give participants a fundamental grounding in cultural theory, cultural history, and 
interculturality, a basic knowledge of the theory and practice of cultural and artistic forms of expression, and the 
ability to reflect on and bridge cultural differences.
Program Outcomes: 
The goals of the program are for participants to a) acquire a basic knowledge of cultural theory and cultural history; 
b) rehearse intercultural dialogue (through contextual studies or language acquisition); and c) engage with cultural 
forms of expression (literature, music, visual arts, and film).

Minor 30 History, Society, Politics
Description:
General description: 
The History, Society, Politics minor study program is offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences for 
Bachelor's students in the Faculty of Business, Economics and Informatics, and the Faculty of Science. Social and 
societal contexts have a great influence on academic disciplines, and help determine how research in these 
disciplines is accepted, promoted, and implemented. An understanding of the temporal and social dimensions and 
of political decisionmaking is therefore an important component of successful research and its application in 
society. This minor study program is designed to address this point of intersection by endeavoring to give 
participants a deeper insight into history, society, and politics. Participants can set their own area of focus through 
their choice of modules.
Program Outcomes: 
Students completing the course will be able to place the knowledge acquired in their major subject in a social, 
political, and historical context, and reflect on it accordingly.

Minor 30 Digital Humanities and Text Mining
Description:
General description: 
The Digital Humanities and Text Mining minor study program is offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences 
for Bachelor's students in the Faculty of Business, Economics and Informatics, and the Faculty of Science. It gives 
insights into a coherent disciplinary field of interrelated themes and content, and allows students to choose their 
own area of focus. We live in a knowledge society where information is generally available in digital, often textual, 
form. While the information needs vary from subject to subject, there is a common denominator, as they all require 
methods and tools to automatically mark and extract the information sought in texts. The Digital Humanities and 
Text Mining study program provides an introduction to the methods and tools used in the computer-aided analysis 
of documents. The methods and knowledge acquired by participants will enable them to do simple analyses in their 
own field.
Program Outcomes: 
The goals of the program include the acquisition of a basic knowledge of programming and the methods and tools 
used to analyze digital documents.

Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich vier Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Softwareentwicklung im Bereich Sprachtechnologie (IT-Firmen): Im 
Tätigkeitsfeld Softwareentwicklung plant und entwickelt man sprachtechnologische Software. 
Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, die Anforderungen zu analysieren, IT-Lösungen zu entwickeln und 
Systeme zu programmieren. Die konkreten Aufgaben hängen dabei vom jeweiligen Anwendungsgebiet ab. 
(2) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, 
Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert 
man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, 
Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich 
Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von Medienberichten, automatische 
Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme 
und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, Kundenanfragen etc.) sind 
Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(3) Terminologie und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(4) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder in der Behörde beinhalten. Die 
Aufgabe besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten 
und zu vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte 
sind in bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. 
Consulting umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der 
Risiken beim Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie.

Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich vier Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Softwareentwicklung im Bereich Sprachtechnologie (IT-Firmen): Im 
Tätigkeitsfeld Softwareentwicklung plant und entwickelt man sprachtechnologische Software. 
Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, die Anforderungen zu analysieren, IT-Lösungen zu entwickeln und 
Systeme zu programmieren. Die konkreten Aufgaben hängen dabei vom jeweiligen Anwendungsgebiet ab. 
(2) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, 
Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert 
man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, 
Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich 
Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von Medienberichten, automatische 
Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme 
und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, Kundenanfragen etc.) sind 
Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(3) Terminologie und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(4) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder in der Behörde beinhalten. Die 
Aufgabe besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten 
und zu vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte 
sind in bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. 
Consulting umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der 
Risiken beim Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie.

Major 120 Comparative Linguistics
Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program have acquired fundamental specialist knowledge in all areas of linguistics, and have 
mastered the analytical skills of the discipline. They have a fundamental knowledge of linguistic theories and 
methods, especially in relation to comparative language research. They have a command of digital data editing and 
management, and know the basics of qualitative and quantitative data analytics. They are familiar with the practice 
of scientific work, presentation, and publication, have an in-depth knowledge of their elective subjects, and have 
built an appropriate portfolio of languages.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Wie viele andere universitäre Studienprogramme führt das Studium der Vergleichenden Sprachwissenschaft nicht 
zu einem bestimmten Beruf. Eines der wichtigsten späteren Tätigkeitsfelder ist die Forschung, die je nach Profil 
ganz unterschiedlich aussehen kann. Interesse an Sprache(n), Freude an Analyse und selbständiges Arbeiten sind 
aber in jedem Fall wichtige Komponenten. 
Ausserhalb der Universität ist es dank des interdisziplinären Charakters des Studienprogramms möglich, in viele 
Bereiche einzusteigen, insbesondere aber in einen der vielen Berufe, die mit Sprache, Text und Kommunikation zu 
tun haben, wie z. B. Lektorat, PR-Beratung, Übersetzung oder Sprachlehre. Je nach Interesse können die 
Kenntnisse von nicht-europäischen Sprachen, die während des Studiums erworben werden, sowie die zusätzlichen 
Qualifikationen aus den Nebenfächern auch als Grundlage dienen, in anderen Feldern wie 
Entwicklungszusammenarbeit oder Computerlinguistik tätig zu werden.

Major 120 Ibero-Romance Literatures and Linguistics
Description:
General description: 
Those who complete the program have acquired a basic knowledge of the following aspects of Spanish and, 
optionally, also Portuguese, with the goal of independently setting their own areas of research focus at Master’s 
level: history of Ibero-Romance literatures from the Middle Ages to the present day (including Latin America) and of 
literary genres, narratology, meter, rhetoric, and textual analysis; construction, usage, and history of language, 
methods of synchronic and diachronic Ibero-Romance linguistics, including methods of corpus linguistics. Those 
completing the course have Spanish communication skills to at least C1 level, plus a basic knowledge of at least 
one contact language of Spanish. They can produce bibliographies, are familiar with the relevant handbooks, take 
a critical approach to secondary literature, and have technical skills in the communication of knowledge. Optionally 
they will have made initial contacts with the academic community.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: Spanish, Portuguese
Career Prospects: 
Die Absolventinnen und Absolventen des Studienprogramms «Iberoromanische Sprach- und 
Literaturwissenschaft» beherrschen die spanische (und fakultativ auch die portugiesische) Sprache und sind 
Experten im Bereich Kommunikation und interkulturelle Vermittlung. Sie haben gelernt, Texte und komplexe 
sprachliche Strukturen zu analysieren und verfügen über Methodenkenntnisse, die auf zahlreiche Fragestellungen 
übertragbar sind. Damit eröffnet sich ihnen eine Vielzahl beruflicher Perspektiven: in der Vermittlung der 
spanischen Sprache an Gymnasien (nach entsprechendem vertiefenden Studium auf Masterebene), in der 
Erwachsenenbildung und im privaten Bildungssektor; im Kulturwesen (Museen, Kulturinstitutionen, Literaturhäuser, 
internationale Organisationen); in Bibliotheken, Mediatheken und Archiven; im Bereich Sprachtechnologie; in den 
Medien (Presse, Radio, Fernsehen, Online-Portale); in internationalen Organisationen; sowie in der Privatwirtschaft 
bei international tätigen Unternehmen.

Major 90 Evolutionary Language Science
Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program are equipped with the specialist linguistic knowledge required to analyze language 
evolution. They have mastered an interdisciplinary approach to language(s) and language development from the 
perspective of biology, anthropology, and cognitive science. They have advanced knowledge of quantitative and 
qualitative analytical methods, experience with the interdisciplinary presentation of research and its findings, and 
are capable of designing and conducting interdisciplinary research.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
Wie viele andere universitäre Studienprogramme führt das Studium der Evolutionären Linguistik nicht zu einem 
bestimmten Beruf. Eines der wichtigsten späteren Tätigkeitsfelder ist die Forschung, die je nach Profil ganz 
unterschiedlich aussehen kann. Interesse an Sprache(n), Freude an Analyse und selbständiges Arbeiten sind aber 
in jedem Fall wichtige Komponenten. Ausserhalb der Universität ist es dank des interdisziplinären Charakters des 
Studienprogramms möglich, in viele Bereiche einzusteigen, insbesondere aber in einen der vielen Berufe, die mit 
Sprache, Text und Kommunikation zu tun haben, wie z. B. Lektorat, PR-Beratung, Übersetzung oder Sprachlehre. 
Je nach Interesse können die Kenntnisse von nicht-europäischen Sprachen, die während des Studiums erworben 
werden, sowie die zusätzlichen Qualifikationen aus den Nebenfächern auch als Grundlage dienen, in anderen 
Feldern wie Entwicklungszusammenarbeit oder Computerlinguistik tätig zu werden.

Single Major 120 Literary Studies
Description:
General description: 
Das Studienprogramm «Literary Studies / Literaturwissenschaft» ermöglicht 
eine vertiefte 
Auseinandersetzung mit aktuellen Forschungsfragen in allen Literaturen, die an 
der Universität Zürich gelehrt werden. Im Vordergrund steht die Entwicklung 
eines eigenen Forschungsprofils im Bereich der Literatur einer bestimmten 
Sprache oder in sprachübergreifender Perspektive. Das Programm vermittelt 
forschungsnah, gegenwartsbezogen und zugleich praxisorientiert das ästhetische 
und epistemologische Potenzial von Literatur. Ein besonderes Gewicht kommt 
dabei der Intermedialitätsforschung sowie der Literaturforschung als Kulturanalyse und Wissensgeschichte zu. Die 
Absolventinnen und Absolventen des 
Studienprogramms sind in der Lage, Forschungsprojekte eigenständig durchzuführen und wissenschaftliche Texte 
unterschiedlicher Genres zu verfassen.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects:

work in cultural, literary, and media analysis. It helps create a deeper understanding of cultural and social 
phenomena, and promotes culture mediation and knowledge transfer skills. Those completing the program 
demonstrate the ability to work on a research-oriented, theoretically and empirically founded, practical basis. They 
can design and realize projects independently, and translate and communicate the findings of cultural studies.

Single Major 120 Philosophy
Description:
General description: 
Philosophy is concerned with the fundamental questions of human existence. By considering human beings as 
sentient, thinking, and cognizant beings and as social, political, and acting subjects, philosophy reflects on the 
fundamentals and conditions not only of science, the mind, and language, but of society and culture. Besides a 
knowledge of the history of philosophy (from antiquity and the Middle Ages to the early modern period and the 19th 
and 20th centuries), the study covers key concepts, problems, and theories from various areas of contemporary 
philosophy (logic and the philosophy of science, metaphysics, cognitive theory, the philosophy of language, 
philosophy of mind, general and applied ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics).
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Die Studierenden der Philosophie erwerben Fähigkeiten, die sie in zahlreichen Berufsfeldern einbringen können. 
Zu den im Studium erworbenen Kompetenzen gehören eine hohe Analyse- und Reflexionskompetenz, ein 
ausgeprägtes methodologisches Bewusstsein, ausgebildete sprachliche, kommunikative, hermeneutische und 
argumentative Fähigkeiten sowie die Fähigkeit und Bereitschaft, Gegebenes kritisch zu hinterfragen. 
Absolventinnen und Absolventen der Philosophie findet man entsprechend in den verschiedensten Bereichen: an 
Gymnasien und Universitäten, in der Kultur und der Politik, zum Beispiel als Kulturmanager oder Diplomatinnen. 
Sie sitzen in Ethikkommissionen ein, beraten Unternehmen und Parteien, sie engagieren sich in NGOs, arbeiten 
als Medienschaffende, als Lektoren in Verlagen oder als Analystinnen in Banken und Versicherungen. 
Wer an philosophischer Forschung interessiert ist, kann nach erfolgreich absolviertem Masterstudium in 
Philosophie ein Dissertationsprojekt verfolgen und eine akademische Lauf- bahn einschlagen. Eine begrenzte 
Anzahl von Assistenzstellen ist mit der Möglichkeit einer Promotion verbunden. 
Dissertationsprojekte werden auch durch den Forschungskredit der UZH und den Schweizerischen Nationalfonds 
(SNF) gefördert. Zusätzlich besteht die Möglichkeit, eine Promotion im Rahmen grösserer Forschungsprojekte 
durchzuführen.

Major 90 Film Studies
Description:
General description: 
The Film Studies major places film in the historical and current context of the arts and media of the 20th and 21st 
centuries. It imparts a deeper knowledge of the history, theory, aesthetics, and technology of film and the cinema. It 
places special emphasis on extending students’ ability to link audiovisual artifacts with other media and arts, and to 
embed them in a broader discursive setting on an interdisciplinary basis. By equipping students to do their own 
methodologically reflective research and engage on an historical-critical basis with the subject at the interface with 
practice, the study program qualifies them for an academic career, but equally for demanding work in film culture, 
the film business, or film policy.

Minor 30 Film Studies
Description:
General description: 
The minor in Film Studies develops in more depth the basic film aesthetics skills acquired at Bachelor’s level and 
students’ knowledge of the history and theory of film. It equips them to critically engage with current and historical 
developments in film and the cinema and place them in a cultural and media context. The program encourages 
students to reflect methodologically and work on their own questions and topics. Parallel to this there are more 
practice-oriented offerings designed to give an insight into aspects of the culture and politics of film. In combination 
with a major from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, the minor in Film Sciences helps students develop the 
technical skills to analyze visual and acoustic phenomena within the framework of their studies in other areas of 
culture and the arts.

Major 90 Gender Studies
Description:
General description: 
Gender Studies encompasses women’s, men’s and gender studies, plus queer theory. It looks into the significance 
of gender and gender difference on an historically-founded, comparative cultural, and theoretically reflective basis, 
inquiring into the relationship between biological, physiological, psychological, and sociocultural differentiation on 
the one hand and processes involved in the social construction of gender and the renegotiation of gender 
boundaries on the other. At UZH the areas of thematic focus are literature and culture, non-European societies, 
transregional and postcolonial studies. A knowledge of gender and critical reflection on gender and gender 
relations are key to an understanding of increasingly complex societies. Those completing the program have a solid 
technical grounding in the discipline equipping them to do independent academic work in the field of gender 
research.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Innerhalb von Forschung und Wissenschaft eröffnen Gender Studies innovative Forschungsperspektiven und 
Tätigkeitsfelder. Darüber hinaus sind die im Studium vermittelten Fachkompetenzen in zahlreichen Praxis-
Bereichen einsetzbar: in öffentlichen und politischen Organisationen, in Unternehmen und Bildungseinrichtungen, 
in Nicht-Regierungs-Organisationen, Medien- und Kulturinstitutionen, Gleichstellungs-, Beratungs-, Sozial- und 
Gesundheitsdiensten.

Minor 30 Gender Studies
Description:
General description: 
Gender Studies encompasses women’s, men’s and gender studies, plus queer theory. It looks into the significance 
of gender and gender difference on an historically-founded, comparative cultural, and theoretically reflective basis, 
inquiring into the relationship between biological, physiological, psychological, and sociocultural differentiation on 
the one hand and processes involved in the social construction of gender and the renegotiation of gender 
boundaries on the other. A knowledge of gender and critical reflection on gender and gender relations are key to an 
understanding of increasingly complex societies. The minor in Gender Studies teaches the relative categories and 
a deeper knowledge of the conceptual, methodological, and theoretical basis of interdisciplinary gender research.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Innerhalb von Forschung und Wissenschaft eröffnen Gender Studies innovative Forschungsperspektiven und 
Tätigkeitsfelder. Darüber hinaus sind die im Studium vermittelten Fachkompetenzen in zahlreichen Praxis-
Bereichen einsetzbar: in öffentlichen und politischen Organisationen, in Unternehmen und Bildungseinrichtungen, 
in Nicht-Regierungs-Organisationen, Medien- und Kulturinstitutionen, Gleichstellungs-, Beratungs-, Sozial- und 
Gesundheitsdiensten.

Major 90 Japanese Studies
Description:
General description: 
The major in Japanese Studies provides the theoretical and methodological basis to engage with questions related 
to Japan from a cultural and social science perspective. Students gain a broader knowledge of modern, academic-
level Japanese, and have the opportunity to gain a deeper knowledge of historical styles of speaking and writing. 
Beyond this they address selected questions of research into Japan, drawing on the relevant original language 
sources and data in conjunction with Japanese and Western research literature. In their final thesis, candidates 
demonstrate their ability to identify academically relevant issues and critically reflect on the latest research with 
reference to appropriate sources and data. The major can be either generic, with a focus on general Japanese 
studies, or with a specific focus on Japanese philology or the social-scientific analysis of Japan.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Ein Master in Japanologie eröffnet berufliche Möglichkeiten in vielen Tätigkeitsfeldern. Den Beruf des 
«Japanologen» oder der «Japanologin» gibt es an sich nicht, doch die im Studium erworbene Kernkompetenz – 
Japan methodisch fundiert analysieren und verstehen – kann in unterschiedlichsten Berufsfeldern eingesetzt 
werden. Absolventinnen und Absolventen werden tätig in der Diplomatie und Verwaltung, im Journalismus, im 
Kulturaustausch, als spezialisierte Übersetzer, in der Privatwirtschaft oder streben eine wissenschaftliche Karriere 
an. Studierende beim Übergang ins Berufsleben aktiv zu unterstützen ist ein besonderes Anliegen der Zürcher 
Japanologie.

and equips candidates to do their own independent scholarly work. Those graduating from the program have 
demonstrated an advanced knowledge of more of these areas, a mastery of spoken and written standard Chinese, 
a familiarity with working with primary sources, a knowledge of research in selected areas in the relevant academic 
languages, expertise in critically contextualizing information in relation to China, and general skills in addressing, 
presenting, and communicating complex issues in German, Chinese, and English. Thanks to the personal and 
social skills and experience in relation to China acquired during the program, those completing the program are 
able to skilfully navigate one of Asia’s largest cultural and economic regions.

Major 90 Italian Literature/Linguistics
Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program have optionally systematically acquired deeper knowledge in various areas of 
language and linguistics. They have a broader knowledge of areas including literary theory and history, methods of 
textual and cultural analysis, and Italo-Romance varieties from Latin to the present day. They are able to apply the 
analytical tools they have acquired to different types of text, linguistic structures, varieties, and communication 
situations, and are equipped to conduct and communicate independent research. 
Graduates are qualified to embark on a further step in their education (such as a doctorate or the Teaching 
Diploma for Upper Secondary Education) or for the large number of careers requiring a knowledge of multiple 
languages, cultural competence, and intellectual independence. Non-native speakers improve their Italian 
language skills to at least C2 level.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: Italian
Career Prospects: 
Il Master in Linguistica e Letteratura Italiana del Romanisches Seminar offre stimolanti prospettive di carriera. Oltre 
alle numerose professioni nel settore terziario (economia; turismo; editoria; media; istituzioni culturali tra cui 
biblioteche, archivi e musei; organizzazioni internazionali; gestione delle risorse umane; professioni nel campo 
delle arti e in agenzie di comunicazione e uffici stampa; mediazione linguistica e culturale; ecc.) alle quali le 
competenze sono trasferibili, il percorso di studi permette alle studentesse e agli studenti di portare a compimento 
la formazione per docenti liceali, a Zurigo (Lehrdiplom für Maturitätsschulen per l’italiano come prima materia di 
insegnamento), in Ticino (Diploma di insegnamento per le scuole di maturità e Master of Arts SUPSI in 
Insegnamento per il livello secondario I) o altrove. Gli stage curricolari (Praktika) ti forniranno non solo una prima 
panoramica generale sulle differenti possibilità lavorative, ma ti permetteranno di acquisire in maniera stimolante 
nuove competenze spendibili nel mondo del lavoro. 
Se invece ti interessa la ricerca e desideri proseguire gli studi anche dopo aver ottenuto il tuo Master, puoi 
intraprendere una formazione dottorale iscrivendoti a un Dottorato di ricerca, che costituisce il più alto livello di 
istruzione universitaria. Fin dal Master hai la possibilità di muovere i primi passi nel mondo della ricerca 
partecipando attivamente a convegni, seminari e workshop, e assistendo a numerose manifestazioni scientifiche 
organizzate dalle cattedre di italianistica.

Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: English
Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich fünf Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Softwareentwicklung im Bereich Sprachtechnologie (IT-Firmen): Im 
Tätigkeitsfeld Softwareentwicklung plant und entwickelt man sprachtechnologische Software. 
Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, die Anforderungen zu analysieren, IT-Lösungen zu entwickeln und 
Systeme zu programmieren. Die konkreten Aufgaben hängen dabei vom jeweiligen Anwendungsgebiet ab. 
(2) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, 
Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert 
man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, 
Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich 
Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von Medienberichten, automatische 
Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme 
und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, Kundenanfragen etc.) sind 
Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(3) Terminologie und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(4) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder der Behörde beinhalten. Die Aufgabe 
besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten und zu 
vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte sind in 
bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. Consulting 
umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der Risiken beim 
Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie. 
(5) Wissenschaft und Forschung: Im Bereich Computerlinguistik und Sprachtechnologie kann sowohl 
Grundlagenforschung wie auch angewandte Forschung betrieben werden. Universitäre Hochschulen bieten 
meistens beide Möglichkeiten, während in der Industrie und an den Fachhochschulen v.a. angewandte Forschung 
stattfindet. Die konkreten Themen sind hier sehr vielfältig und abhängig von der jeweiligen Institution und 
Forschungsstelle.

Major 90 Greek Philology
Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program have a deeper knowledge of Greek language and literature in all its breadth, from 
Homer and the classical period to late antiquity, influenced by the emergence of Christianity. They can deal with 
confidence with very demanding original texts in a variety of genres. In their interpretations they draw on both 
traditional (e.g. textual philology) and modern approaches to literary, cultural, and linguistic interpretation. They also 
have the ability to recognize and assess intercultural relationships. In their Master’s thesis they have shown that 
they can do independent scholarly work and complete a complex task to a deadline. In general they have 
consolidated the basic attitudes acquired at Bachelor’s level (such as intellectual curiosity, old-fashioned creative 
thinking, etc.), preparing them for a variety of careers and professions both inside and outside the university.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Der Masterabschluss in Griechischer Philologie ist die Qualifikation für die Ausübung wissenschaftlicher Tätigkeit in 
Forschung und Lehre und bildet auch die fachwissenschaftliche Voraussetzung für das Lehrdiplom für 
Maturitätsschulen, wobei für das 1. Unterrichtsfach ein Major und für das 2. ein Minor verlangt wird. Wegen des 
Erwerbs überfachlicher Kompetenzen (wie Genauigkeit, Ausdauer und Selbstständigkeit) eröffnen sich weitere 
Tätigkeitsbereiche wie Bibliotheken, Archive, Verlage, öffentliche Verwaltung, Museen und andere kulturelle 
Institutionen, Banken, Versicherungen, Journalismus, Verlagswesen, Kulturmanagement und Medienarbeit im 
weiteren Sinne, internationale Organisationen, Tourismus, Diplomatie.

Minor 30 Medieval Latin Philology
Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program have a basic knowledge of the language and are familiar with different registers of 
Latin. They can apply the relevant tools of Medieval Latin philology with confidence. They have improved their 
reading skills on the basis of primary texts. They have familiarized themselves with methods of transmission and 
textual criticism and different approaches to literary and cultural interpretation. They can present complex issues on 
their own and communicate their own research opinions persuasively. They are practiced in presenting their own 
findings in a manner appropriate to the audience and have experience in scholarly argumentation. They are well 
versed in independently solving linguistic problems and general problems of interpretation in Latin texts from the 
Middle Ages.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Die Berufsperspektiven dieses Minors hängen wesentlich vom gewählten Major-Studienprogramm ab. Die 
Kompetenzen, lateinische Texte des Mittelalters zu verstehen und mit mittelalterlichen Handschriften umzugehen, 
sind häufig eine notwendige Ergänzung für historische arbeitende Fächer wie die Geschichte, Germanistik, 
Kunstgeschichte, Romanistik und Anglistik. Für Latinisten bedeutet die Mittellateinische Philologie eine wichtige 
Erweiterung, die auch neue Möglichkeiten für den Unterricht eröffnet. Neben Lehre und/oder Forschung sind als 
Tätigkeitsfelder insbesondere Bibliotheken, Archive, Verlage, öffentliche Verwaltung, Museen und andere kulturelle 
Institutionen, Journalismus, Kulturmanagement und Medienarbeit im weiteren Sinne zu nennen. Diese 
verschiedenen Berufe früherer Absolventinnen und Absolventen erklären sich dadurch, dass überfachliche 
Kompetenzen wie Genauigkeit, Ausdauer und Selbstständigkeit erworben werden, die in allen möglichen 
Tätigkeitsbereichen hilfreich sind.

Minor 30 Digital Linguistics
Description:
General description: 
Those completing the program are familiar with methods of linguistic data acquisition and have acquired knowledge 
in the automatic processing and analysis of large corpora and databases. They have programming skills and have 
deepened their knowledge in topics of their own choice, such as machine learning, machine translation, text 
mining, the semantic web, and parsing. They are able to read research papers on linguistics and language 
technology and apply the latest methods to large collections of linguistic data.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: English
Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich drei Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, 
Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -
analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. 
Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen 
aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von 
Medienberichten, automatische Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. 
Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, 
Kundenanfragen etc.) sind Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(2) Terminologie und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(3) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder der Behörde beinhalten. Die Aufgabe 
besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten und zu 
vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte sind in 
bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. Consulting 
umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der Risiken beim 
Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie.

Minor 60 Ancient Studies
Description:
General description: 
This interdisciplinary study program is an exemplary introduction to the multifaceted world of culture in 
Mediterranean antiquity, which still resonates powerfully today. Those completing the program are familiar with the 
most important scholarly methods and tools (including digital tools). They have specialized in two of the four areas 
of antiquity – literatures and their languages, material cultures, historical events and developments, religions and 
philosophical traditions – and have built a relevant portfolio of languages. 
They can analyze scientific data independently and critically question research opinions. They are practiced in 
presenting complex issues appropriately for the audience in question. In general they have adopted intellectual 
curiosity, stamina, meticulous accuracy and the courage to indulge in old-fashioned creative thinking as 
fundamental attitudes, and have acquired intercultural skills by comparing antiquity and modernity.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
Die Berufsperspektiven dieses Minors hängen wesentlich vom gewählten Major-Studienprogramm ab. In der Regel 
schliesst sich an den Bachelor in Altertumswissenschaften ein Master im gleichen Bereich an, also ein Minor-
Studienprogramm im Umfang von 30 oder ein Mono-Studienprogramm im Umfang von 120 ECTS Credits. Bereits 
der Bachelor-Abschluss qualifiziert jedoch für Tätigkeiten in den verschiedensten Bereichen, darunter im Bildungs- 
und Bibliothekswesen sowie im Kultursektor, in der öffentlichen Verwaltung und im Journalismus. Er eröffnet 
Zugänge zu Spezialausbildungen und Aufbaustudien, über die sich ein breites Feld weiterer beruflicher Tätigkeiten 
erschliesst.

Single Major 120 Ancient Studies
Description:
General description: 
The study program addresses the entire ancient world of the Mediterranean on a cross-disciplinary basis, from its 
beginnings in the orient via Greece and Rome to late antiquity, influenced by the emergence of Christianity. Those 
completing the program have consolidated scholarly know-how in three of the four areas of antiquity – literatures 
and their languages, material cultures, historical events and developments, religions and philosophical traditions. 
This knowledge equips them to create and work on individual projects and present them appropriately for the 
audience in question. In their Master’s thesis they have shown that they can do independent scholarly work and 
complete a complex task to a deadline. In general they have consolidated the basic attitudes they endeavored to 
develop at Bachelor’s level (such as intellectual curiosity, intercultural competence, etc.), preparing them for a 
variety of careers and professions both inside and outside the university.
Program Outcomes:

Minor 30 Ancient Studies
Description:
General description: 
The study program fosters an interdisciplinary approach to the ancient world of 
the Mediterranean in more depth. Those completing the program have consolidated 
scholarly know-how in two of the four areas of antiquity – literatures and their 
languages, material cultures, historical events and developments, religions and 
philosophical traditions. They have learned to handle the relevant tools with 
confidence, and at the same time have further built their language portfolio. 
They are familiar with the history of ancient and classical studies and the 
most important trends in contemporary research. They have experience in leading 
discussions and in scholarly argument, and in communicating complex issues. In 
general they have consolidated the attitudes they endeavored to develop at 
Bachelor’s level (such as intellectual curiosity, intercultural competence, 
etc.), preparing them for a variety of careers and professions both inside and

Minor 30 Economic History
Description:
General description: 
Historians and economists use different models and terminologies to explain economic developments, and 
business and economic policy decisions. The interdisciplinary study program removes these barriers to 
understanding to build a productive relationship of cooperation between the two disciplines. 
Economists learn about the significance of historical factors, while historians gain familiarity with the argumentation 
and research contexts of economics. The study program is cross-epochal, cross-faculty, and interdisciplinary. It 
combines quantitative and qualitative methods and brings different topics together.
Program Outcomes: 
 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
Das Studienprogramm eröffnet ein breites Tätigkeitsfeld in Forschung und Lehre, Grossunternehmen und KMUs. 
Darüber hinaus qualifiziert es für Führungsfunktionen in Unternehmen, Stiftungen, Berufsverbänden und

Career Prospects: 
Der Major «Deutsche Sprach-/Literaturwissenschaft» bereitet die Studierenden für die spätere Beschäftigung in 
einer Vielzahl von Tätigkeitsfeldern vor, in denen der wissenschaftlich fundierte und spezialisierte Umgang mit 
deutscher Sprache und Literatur gefragt ist, wie etwa schulische und ausserschulische Ausbildung, 
Sprachvermittlung, Verlagswesen, kulturelle Einrichtungen (Theater, Bibliotheken, Museen, Literaturhäuser u.ä.), 
PR und Marketing u.a. Sie sind aber auch für vielfältige andere Aufgaben etwa im Bankenwesen, in der Verwaltung 
oder im Projektmanagement vorbereitet, die ein geschultes analytisches Denken und die Fähigkeit, komplexe 
Strukturen und Zusammenhänge zu erkennen, voraussetzen. Das Studienprogramm bildet die Voraussetzung für 
die Gymnasiallehrerinnen und -lehrerausbildung. Es bereitet aber auch auf weiterführende wissenschaftliche 
Tätigkeiten vor, z. B. im Rahmen eines Doktoratsstudiums oder für die Anstellung bei einer wissenschaftlichen 
Institution (Forschungsinstitute, Archive, Universitäten, Stiftungen u.ä.).

Major 90 Social Anthropology
Description:
General description: 
Social anthropology focuses on human cultures and societies. It studies the ecological, economic, political, legal, 
social, and cultural dimensions of human sociality in its diversity and historical development. It 
place the emphasis on the empirical, comparative, and theoretically reflective 
analysis of a wide range of topics, for example everyday practice, social and 
religious movements, conflicts, and development organizations. Master's students do a research-based degree. 
Research is done either in Switzerland or 
abroad, in an ethnographic museum or on the basis of literature. Those completing the program further develop 
their ability to work scientifically, 
deepen their knowledge of the theories and methods of social anthropology, and familiarize themselves with the 
ethnography of a particular 
region of the world. They learn to quickly understand new contexts and grasp 
their systematic character, and are able to act competently under complex 
conditions.

Major 120 Study of Religions
Description:
General description: 
The Bachelor's degree program in Religious Studies as a major program of study is designed as a wide-ranging 
scholarly introduction to the historical and contemporary relationships between religion, culture, and society. The 
core curriculum for this program at the University of Zurich is divided into three pillars that complement one another 
in terms of methodology and subject matter. 
These pillars involve the study of religions from a historical-comparative, social science, and systematic-theoretical 
perspective. Here, basic courses impart knowledge of various religious traditions, while language courses allow for 
an in-depth study of individual sources and traditions. Finally, methodology courses teach students various 
techniques for collecting and analyzing data. Lectures and seminars address the transformation of the meaning 
and function of religion throughout history and in the present day. The historical dynamics of religious history, 
alternative forms of religion, and the interaction between religion and society are systematically covered as well. 
The Bachelor's degree program in Religious Studies as a major program of study can be combined with a minor 
program of study offered by the Faculty of Theology or another faculty.

Major 150 Biomedicine
Description:
General description: 
The major study program Biomedicine (150 ECTS credits) teaches the relevant basic principles in Physics, 
Chemistry, Mathematics, Cell and Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics as well as 
Physiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology. The focus is on achieving an integrative view of the functions of the 
human body in connection with causes of diseases. In the area of general competencies the emphasis is on 
scientific reasoning, working and presentation. The Bachelor’s degree in Biomedicine qualifies for professional 
activities requiring a profound knowledge of the human body. 
Program structure: During the first 2 years (1 - 4 semester, basic studies) the focus is on sciences such as 
Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Mathematics as well as Anatomy and Physiology. In the third year (5 and 6 
semester, Fachstudium) specific molecular aspects of the function of the human body as well as major diseases 
will be studied using biomedical research methods.
Program Outcomes: 
Graduates of the Major Study Program Bachelor in Biomedicine (150 ECTS Credits) are able to apply their sound 
knowledge in scientific, biological and medical subjects as well as in biostatistics and bioinformatics in the solution 
of biomedical questions in theory and practice and to recognize, describe and explain biomedical concepts and 
phenomena. 
 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
A permanent professional position is hardly possible with a Bachelor’s degree, at best it is only possible to do an 
internship or to enter a training program in private or public companies. The prerequisite for employment is 
normally a Master’s degree.
Further Study Options: 
The Major degree in Biomedicine at the Bachelor’s level (Major Study Program worth 150 ECTS Credits) entitles to 
enrol for the Major Study Programs in Biomedicine at the Master’s level with no further conditions. The admission 
to related Master Programs (biology, biochemistry) is possible. For these programs, however, the formal enrolment 
may depend on the fulfilment of additional requirements or conditions. The admission to specialized Master 
programs (e.g. biostatistics) an application is necessary.
Requirements:
Admission Requirements: 
The conditions for admission to the Bachelor’s degree programme are regulated in: „Verordnung über die 
Zulassung zum Studium an der Universität Zürich (VZS)".
Particulars/Requirements:

Application Deadline: 
Grading: The student's achievement is assessed at the end of each module. 
Achievements are graded on a scale from 1 to 6, whereby 6 denotes the highest grade 
of achievement and 1 the lowest. A grade below 4 is insufficient. Achievements can 
also be graded with 'passed' or 'failed'.
Regulations: 
Page 2,035 of 2,924
Organization:
Program Structure: The compulsory modules (110 ECTS) of the basic studies (1st-4th semester) cover the 
natural sciences (chemistry, physics, biochemistry), the basic and applied 
mathematics (analysis, statistics, programming, data analysis), the relevant biological 
subjects (molecular genetics, cell biology, evolution and developmental biology of 
humans, microbiology, neurobiology) and the medical subjects (anatomy, physiology, 
pathophysiology, immunology, virology). In the elective modules (40 ECTS) of the 
advanced studies (5th and 6th semester), knowledge of molecular and cellular 
mechanisms of important human diseases is acquired, as well as biomedical research 
methods for their diagnosis, therapy and prevention. The main part of the 3rd year of 
study is formed by practical courses in research courses of the Faculty (e.g. in the 
Institutes of Physiology, Medical Virology, Experimental Immunology, Molecular 
Cancer Research, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Molecular Life Sciences, Anatomy, 
quantitative biomedicine, etc.) and in various University hospitals in Zurich. 
There, students get the possibility to find their thematic priority within biomedicine or to 
choose a program within the Biology Master.
Major/Minor-Combinations: The Major Study Program in Biomedicine worth 150 ECTS Credits can be combined 
with a Minor Study Program worth 30 ECTS credits. Minor Study Programs can be 
chosen from the entire range of subjects offered by the University of Zurich. A Minor 
Study Program starts in the second year of study. In the second year of study, all 
elective modules are replaced with modules of the Minor Study Program (10 ECTS), in 
the third year a part of elective modules are replaced with modules of the Minor Study 
Program (20 ECTS). 
Part-Time Studies: Part-time studies are well possible due to the modular structure of the basic study 
period. However, the duration of studies will be extended and it must be noted that the 
sequence of compulsory modules of the basic study period is constructive. The third 
regular year of studies for the Bachelor's degree (advanced studies) contains block 
courses and lectures that take up the whole working week. Part-time students thus 
have to organize their time in advanced studies to ensure their presence in coherent 
time blocks of at least three and a half weeks. If necessary, the study counselling 
service can be contacted.

Die Medizin baut auf den Gesetzen und der Denkweise der Naturwissenschaften auf und versucht, die 
biologischen Fakten des Menschen und ihre Störungen rational und, wenn möglich, numerisch zu erfassen, auf 
dieser Grundlage Diagnosen zu stellen und Behandlungen durchzuführen. Vorkenntnisse und besondere 
Interessen im Bereich der Naturwissenschaften sind daher von Vorteil. 
In der klinischen Medizin sind auch die zwischenmenschlichen Beziehungen und psychologische, soziale und 
ökonomische Aspekte von grosser Bedeutung. Spass am Umgang mit Menschen sollten die zukünftigen 
Studierenden mitbringen.

Single Major 180 Veterinary Medicine
Description:
General description: 
Veterinary Medicine deals with all measures, including breeding, husbandry, nutrition and treatment, that promote 
animal health and wellbeing. Veterinarians carry out research on the prevention and treatment of diseases, work 
toward protecting people against illnesses contracted from animals and endeavor to apply controls on animal-
based foodstuffs. In addition, veterinarians are active in issues of animal and environmental protection. 
The Bachelor’s degree in Veterinary Medicine qualifies students to continue studying toward a Master’s degree.
Program Outcomes: 
The Bachelor’s degree in Veterinary Medicine furnishes students with a good background in scientific, veterinary 
and medical knowledge, basic skills for veterinary procedures and basic clinical knowledge. 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
The Bachelor’s degree program does not prepare students to immediately embark on a career as a vet, but 
provides students with the knowledge necessary to move on to the Master’s degree program in Veterinary 
Medicine. Following completion of the Bachelor’s degree program, students of Veterinary Medicine generally study 
toward a Master’s degree in the field.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in the same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Where the subject is changed, the faculty can require proof of additional competences beyond 
those acquired in the Bachelor's program. This is also applicable to acceptance onto specialized Master's courses. 
In any event, even when the Master's course is in the same subject, the faculty can make the completion of a 
Master's degree dependent on the fulfillment of additional requirements. These requirements can also be fulfilled 
during the Master's course. The details are set out in the framework rules and the study rules.

Further Study Options: 
After achieving their Master’s degree, many chemists complete a doctoral thesis 
which takes three to four years for the practical part if they have no professional commitments elsewhere. Doctoral 
students are also required to 
further add to their theoretical knowledge of chemistry by attending both 
specialist lectures / courses and seminars / conferences that cultivate independent thinking and foster a profound 
knowledge of chemistry. In addition, 
students have the main responsibility for organizing their PhD studies. Doctoral students must take on a small 
amount of teaching, e.g. as a teaching 
assistant in practical training. Conferral of the doctorate demonstrates the 
ability to solve a problem independently, both in theory and in practice.

General description: 
The degree program Teaching Diploma for Upper Secondary Education in one subject is a teaching qualification 
that supplements an individual's subject-specific Master's degree. The program is designed to impart pedagogical 
and methodological skills and is structured into three areas: education studies, subject-specific teaching, and 
teaching practice. During their studies, participants acquire the ability to plan, design, and evaluate lessons that 
challenge learners and that are geared to their cognitive level. Upon completing the program, graduates have 
acquired sound theoretical knowledge as well as professional skills and competencies, thus qualifying them to 
teach their subject at upper secondary schools (baccalaureate schools, specialized schools, and – with the 
necessary additional qualification – vocational baccalaureate schools). They are furthermore able to help their 
students achieve a university entrance qualification and to foster their ability to think independently and act 
responsibly.

admission, on recognition of similar degrees, and on conditions and/or additional requirements that may apply. As a 
rule, the language of instruction 
in the PhD programs is English. All applicants whose native language is not 
English, or whose prior studies have not been conducted in English, are required to provide proof of sufficient 
knowledge of English.

Admission Requirements: 
Für die Zulassung zum Masterstudium ist ein Bachelor of Law einer schweizerischen universitären Hochschule 
notwendig. Studierende mit einem ausländischen Bachelor of Law oder einem gleichwertigen Abschluss können 
mit Auflagen im Umfang von maximal 60 ECTS Credits zum Masterstudium zugelassen werden. 
Da die bisherigen Masterprogramme mit Schwerpunkt nur noch bis und mit Frühjahrssemester 2021 angeboten 
werden, sind nur noch Einschreibungen für das Masterprogramm ohne Schwerpunkt möglich. 
Wer an der Rechtswissenschaftlichen Fakultät der Universität Zürich oder an einer anderen schweizerischen 
Rechtsfakultät endgültig abgewiesen worden ist, wird nicht mehr zum Studium der Rechtswissenschaft zugelassen. 
Weitere Informationen erhalten Sie bei der Studienberatung.

Single Major 90 Law
Description:
General description: 
The double degree Master’s program jointly undertaken with the partner faculty offers students an opportunity to 
expand and further their knowledge of the Swiss legal system, of the legal system of the country of the partner 
faculty and of international law. It consists of the Master's degree program at the Faculty of Law and the study 
program at a partner faculty. At the Faculty of Law UZH students can choose between two study programs, each 
comprising 90 ECTS credits. A fixed total of 30 ECTS credits earned in coursework completed as part of the study 
program at the partner faculty will be transferred. Thus, modules amounting to 60 ECTS credits have to be 
completed at the Faculty of Law UZH. For full-time students, the double degree program lasts four semesters. 
The study program Law provides the students with legal knowledge, the skills to analyze the legal system and the 
ability to reflect on the basic principles and content of legal normativity and jurisprudence. The students can choose 
a large part of the modules to be completed from the entire Master's program of the Faculty of Law. Thus offering 
students considerable freedom to pursue their individual interests and to set individual emphases. The program 
prepares and qualifies the students for work in science and research and equips them with the necessary skills to 
practice in the legal professions.

Single Major 90 Computational Science (specialized Master)
Description:
General description: 
The specialized single major study program in Computational Science (90 ECTS credits) at Master’s level provides 
students with in-depth techniques in computational and simulation science. The increasing power of computers has 
made calculations possible that were unthinkable a decade ago. The high level of complexity of scientific problems 
and industrial modeling can today be surmounted by modern computers and novel computational methods. These 
skills can now be considered as part of the technical foundation of scientists. The program provides students with 
the necessary skills and knowledge in computational sciences to conduct independent scientific research. Students 
are required to attend compulsory courses and seminars worth 15-25 ECTS credits. 35-40 ECTS credits are 
earned in elective modules. The compulsory master's thesis (30 ECTS credits) and master's examination complete 
the education.
Program Outcomes: 
Graduates of the spec. master's program acquire the following knowledge: 
 
- Methodological foundations for simulation in the natural sciences. 
 
- Numerical methods for differential equations in simulations 
 
- Advanced high-performance computing 
 
- Methods for visualization of simulation data 
 
- Machine learning in the sciences 
Additional learning objectives (elective modules) relate to the different application areas: 
 
- Computational Physics and Astrophysics 
 
- Computational chemistry 
 
- Computer Graphics 
 
- Applications in Earth and Environmental sciences 
Languages of Instruction: English
Career Prospects: 
Graduates are well prepared for careers in academia or scientifically oriented industry. The program is inherently 
interdisciplinary, allowing students to work across boundaries in a dynamic environment and learn a wide range of 
numerical methods and their application in various fields. 
Doctoral studies in one of several disciplines is another obvious option.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Master's degree entitles the student to continue studying at the doctoral level. The faculty can make 
admission to a Doctorate course dependent on further conditions. The details are set out in the corresponding rules 
for Doctorates.
Requirements:
Admission Requirements: 
The specialized mono/major study program Computational Science (90 ECTS credits) at Master's level requires 
one of the three UZH minor study programs Computational Science 60, Data Analysis in Natural Sciences, 
Simulations in Natural Sciences 30 or at least 30 ECTS credits from applied mathematics and programming 
modules during the bachelor's degree.

General description: 
The single major study program in Biodiversity (90 ECTS credits) at Master’s level immerses students in the 
foundational research fields within biodiversity sciences, such as ecology, evolutionary biology, and environmental 
sciences, complemented by related disciplines. Students apply their solid foundational knowledge in natural 
sciences to tackle significant scientific and societal challenges. MSc in Biodiversity graduates are proficient in 
conducting independent scientific research, from planning to execution. They are adept at presenting research 
findings to professional audiences and contributing to scientific literature. 
The programme is structured as a major study, with a twelve-month EEE 500 Master thesis (60 ECTS), the 
compulsory module EEE 520 "Integrated Knowledge in Biodiversity" (10 ECTS), and elective course modules 
amounting to 20 ECTS. The Master's thesis, usually pursued full-time, is the culmination of the programme. 
Program Outcomes: 
MSc in Biodiversity graduates exhibit a versatile skill set, enabling them to understand and articulate the scientific 
underpinnings of both global and local biodiversity and environmental science issues. They independently conduct 
research in fields like biodiversity science, ecology, evolutionary biology, behavioural biology, and environmental 
science. Graduates employ interdisciplinary perspectives, incorporating insights also from the social sciences. They 
excel in collecting, evaluating, and interpreting data independently, critically scrutinising the validity and reliability of 
their own and others' data and methods. With these skills, graduates are well-positioned for success in academic 
and non-academic sectors. 
Languages of Instruction: English

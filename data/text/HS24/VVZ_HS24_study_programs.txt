Single Major 180 Biology
Description:
General description: 
The single major study program in Biology (180 ECTS credits) provides students with a general education in 
Natural Sciences, knowledge in all research areas of Biology and the capability to think and work methodically and 
scientifically. Course components: In the compulsory modules (90 ECTS credits) of the basic studies curriculum, 
students learn important concepts in all biological disciplines, from the molecular level, through genes, cells, 
individuals, populations and up to ecosystems. At the same time students gain basic knowledge of Mathematics, 
Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry. Following their interests, students choose core elective modules (30 ECTS 
credits) of biology-related fields already during their basic studies. During the advanced studies curriculum (60 
ECTS credits) students develop their knowledge in areas of their choice in block courses and special lectures and 
in elective modules.
Program Outcomes: 
A bachelor major study program Biology taken for 150 or 120 ECTS imparts the same foundational knowledge on 
students as a single major study program (180 ECTS), but they differ in the breadth of knowledge that is taught. 
Both options teach students foundational theory and praxis in Biology as well as in other foundational subjects in 
the natural sciences. Students learn to think and work systematically and scientifically. 
Languages of Instruction: English, German
Career Prospects: 
With a BSc in biology, graduates have the necessary theoretical and practical qualifications for the Master's degree 
course in one of the consecutive Master's concentrations in biology, and depending on the choice of optiona core 
modules, for the Master's program in biomedicine, biochemistry and specialized Master programs such as 
biostatistics or environmental science. The first degree of BSc in biology is also suitable for a start in all types of 
training and education programs of private and public companies.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Where the subject is changed, the faculty can require proof of additional competences. This is 
also applicable to acceptance onto specialized Master's programs. 
The details are set out in the framework rules and the study rules.
Requirements:
Admission Requirements: 
The conditions for admission to the Bachelor's degree programme are regulated in: "Verordnung über die 
Zulassung zum Studium an der Universität Zürich (VZS)".
Branch of Study: Biology
Grading: The student's achievement is assessed at the end of each module. 
Achievements are graded on a scale from 1 to 6, whereby 6 denotes the highest grade 
of achievement and 1 the lowest. A grade below 4 is insufficient. 
Achievements can also be graded with 'passed' or 'failed'.

Major/Minor-Combinations: A study program Biology 180 is a single major study program. A major study program 
Biology 120 can be combined with a minor study program 60. A major study program 
Biology 150 can be combined with a minor study program 30. 
Minor study programs can be chosen from the entire range of subjects offered by the 
University of Zurich. A minor study program starts in the second year of study.
Part-Time Studies: The basic studies of the Bachelor's degree program in biology are particul suitable for 
part-time studies. This naturally leads though to a prolonged period of studies. The 
order of the compulsory modules during basic studies in the regular degree program is 
not binding. If basic studies are completed in 6 or 8 instead of 4 semesters you should 
nevertheless try to complete the mathematics before the physics and the chemistry 
before the biochemistry elements. The third regular year of studies for the Bachelor's 
degree (adv studies) contains block courses and lectures that take up the whole 
working week. Part-time students thus have to organize their time in advanced studies 
to ensure their presence in coherent time blocks of at least three and a half weeks.

Major 120 Biology
Description:
General description: 
The major study program in Biology (120 ECTS credits) provides students with a general education in Natural 
Sciences, knowledge in all research areas of Biology and the capability to think and work methodically and 
scientifically. 
Course components: In the compulsory modules (90 ECTS credits) of the basic studies curriculum, students learn 
important concepts in all biological disciplines, from the molecular level, through genes, cells, individuals, 
populations and up to ecosystems. At the same time students gain basic knowledge of Mathematics, Physics, 
Chemistry and Biochemistry. During the advanced studies curriculum (30 ECTS credits) students develop their 
knowledge in areas of their choice in block courses and special lectures.
Program Outcomes: 
A bachelor major study program Biology taken for 150 or 120 ECTS imparts the same foundational knowledge on 
students as a mono study program (180 ECTS), but they differ in the breadth of knowledge that is taught. Both 
options teach students foundational theory and praxis in Biology as well as in other foundational subjects in the 
natural sciences. Students learn to think and work systematically and scientifically. 
Languages of Instruction: English, German
Career Prospects: 
With a BSc in biology, graduates have the necessary theoretical and practical qualifications for the Master's degree 
course in one of the consecutive Master's concentrations in biology, and depending on the choice of optiona core 
modules, for the Master's program in biomedicine, biochemistry and specialized Master programs such as 
biostatistics or environmental science. The first degree of BSc in biology is also suitable for a start in all types of 
training and education programs of private and public companies.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Where the subject is changed, the faculty can require proof of additional competences. This is 
also applicable to acceptance onto specialized Master's programs. 
The details are set out in the framework rules and the study rules.

Major/Minor-Combinations: A study program Biology 180 is a single major study program. A major study program 
Biology 120 can be combined with a minor study program 60. A major study program 
Biology 150 can be combined with a minor study program 30. 
Minor study programs can be chosen from the entire range of subjects offered by the 
University of Zurich. A minor study program starts in the second year of study. 
Part-Time Studies: The basic studies of the Bachelor's degree program in biology are particul suitable for 
part-time studies. This naturally leads though to a prolonged period of studies. The 
order of the compulsory modules during basic studies in the regular degree program is 
bottom-up. The third regular year of studies for the Bachelor's degree (advanced 
studies) contains block courses and lectur that take up the whole working week. Part-
time students thus have to organize their time in advanced studies to ensure their 
presence in coherent time blocks of at least three and a half weeks. The instrument for 
planning individual programs of studies is the guideline on studying biology at the

General description: 
General and Comparative Literature involves investigating literature both in its uniqueness and in its diversity 
across languages, and the commonalities and differences that emerge. On the general literature side, those 
completing the program have a basic knowledge of poetics and literary aesthetics: What is literature? How is it 
produced and received? What regional and historical commonalities and differences are there? On the comparative 
literature side, they are able to analyze the relationships between texts in different languages (primarily German, 
French, and English) and literatures in dialogue with other arts and cultural manifestations and processes in the 
form of their own areas of focus.

Major 150 Biology
Description:
General description: 
The major study program in Biology (150 ECTS credits) provides students with a general education in Natural 
Sciences, knowledge in all research areas of Biology and the capability to think and work methodically and 
scientifically. 
Course components: In the compulsory modules (90 ECTS credits) of the basic studies curriculum, students learn 
important concepts in all biological disciplines, from the molecular level, through genes, cells, individuals, 
populations and up to ecosystems. At the same time students gain basic knowledge of Mathematics, Physics, 
Chemistry and Biochemistry. Following their interests, students choose core elective modules (15 ECTS credits) of 
biology-related fields already during their basic studies. During the advanced studies curriculum (45 ECTS credits) 
students develop their knowledge in areas of their choice in block courses and special lectures.
Program Outcomes: 
A bachelor major study program Biology taken for 150 or 120 ECTS imparts the same foundational knowledge on 
students as a single major study program (180 ECTS), but they differ in the breadth of knowledge that is taught. 
Both options teach students foundational theory and praxis in Biology as well as in other foundational subjects in 
the natural sciences. Students learn to think and work systematically and scientifically. 
Languages of Instruction: English, German
Career Prospects: 
With a BSc in biology, graduates have the necessary theoretical and practical qualifications for the Master's degree 
course in one of the consecutive Master's concentrations in biology, and depending on the choice of optiona core 
modules, for the Master's program in biomedicine, biochemistry and specialized Master programs such as 
biostatistics or environmental science. The first degree of BSc in biology is also suitable for a start in all types of 
training and education programs of private and public companies.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Where the subject is changed, the faculty can require proof of additional competences. This is 
also applicable to acceptance onto specialized Master's programs. 
The details are set out in the framework rules and the study rules.
Requirements:
Admission Requirements: 
The conditions for admission to the Bachelor's degree programme are regulated in: "Verordnung über die 
Zulassung zum Studium an der Universität Zürich (VZS)".
Branch of Study: Biology
Grading: The student's achievement is assessed at the end of each module. 
Achievements are graded on a scale from 1 to 6, whereby 6 denotes the highest grade 
of achievement and 1 the lowest. A grade below 4 is insufficient. 
Achievements can also be graded with 'passed' or 'failed'.

Major/Minor-Combinations: A study program Biology 180 is a single major study program. A major study program 
Biology 120 can be combined with a minor study program 60. A major study program 
Biology 150 can be combined with a minor study program 30. 
Minor study programs can be chosen from the entire range of subjects offered by the 
University of Zurich. A minor study program starts in the second year of study. 
Part-Time Studies: The basic studies of the Bachelor's degree program in biology are particul suitable for 
part-time studies. This naturally leads though to a prolonged period of studies. The 
order of the compulsory modules during basic studies in the regular degree program is 
bottom-up. The third regular year of studies for the Bachelor's degree (advanced 
studies) contains block courses and lectur that take up the whole working week. Part-
time students thus have to organize their time in advanced studies to ensure their 
presence in coherent time blocks of at least three and a half weeks. The instrument for 
planning individual programs of studies is the guideline on studying biology at the 
University of Zurich: http://www.biologie.uzh.ch

core areas of mathematics and the capability to think methodically and scientifically. The program begins with 
lectures in analysis and linear algebra as well as introductions to programming and logic and set theory. From the 
third semester onwards, lectures from all central areas of mathematics have to be taken; these can be increasingly 
freely chosen from a wide choice of optional subjects. Students are trained in giving presentations on mathematical 
themes in at least two seminars.
Program Outcomes: 
The study of Mathematics at UZH offers a broad education in the foundations of Mathematics. The program fosters 
students ability independently to think inter-connectedly and scientifically. Students take on personal responsibility 
for their work process, the composition of their studies and for their future careers. In the face of challenges 
involved with their studies, students can distinguish themselves by demonstrating a high degree of creativity, 
flexibility, motivation and collegiality. 
Languages of Instruction: English, German
Career Prospects: 
An increasing number of fields (engineering sciences, economics, medicine, etc.) in our world are being "infiltrated" 
by mathematics and its applications. Which is why the career opportunities for mathematicians and very good and 
extremely varied. The skills trained and knowledge acquired during your studies lead to a broad spectrum of 
possibilities. Mathematicians are needed, for example, in: 
   
- innovative high-tech companies   
- companies with a natural sciences or engineering profile   
- software firms or software departments of larger companies   
- insurance companies and banks   
- the teaching profession. 
Well-trained mathematicians are inestimably important, not least because they ensure the upcoming generation of 
scientists in information technology as well as engineering and natural sciences.
Further Study Options: 
The Bachelor degree can be followed by master's studies. The Bachelor degree should not be understood so much 
as a professional qualification; there has as yet been no specific demand for a Bachelor in Mathematics on the part 
of business. Rather it is seen as a bridge to Master studies or acts a mobility hinge to begin a Masters academic 
program at a different university or in different subject areas.
Requirements:
Admission Requirements: 
The conditions for admission to the Bachelor's degree programme are regulated in: "Verordnung über die 
Zulassung zum Studium an der Universität Zürich (VZS)".
Branch of Study: Mathematics
Grading: The student's achievement is assessed at the end of each module. 
Achievements are graded on a scale from 1 to 6, whereby 6 denotes the highest grade 
of achievement and 1 the lowest. A grade below 4 is insufficient. Achievements can 
also be graded with 'passed' or 'failed'.

Major/Minor-Combinations: A study program in Mathematics 180 is a single major study program. A major study 
program Mathematics 120 can be combined with a minor study program 60. A major 
study program in Mathematics 150 can be combined with a minor study program 30. 
A minor study program starts in the second year of study. Minor study programs can 
be chosen from the entire range of subjects offered by the University of Zurich. 
Part-Time Studies: Part-time studies are possible on account of the modular structure of the course. The 
duration of study is accordingly longer A concrete individual model for part-time studies 
must be discussed in advance with the relevant academic advisor.

sciences areas where analytical, structured thinking together with essential networking is required. Many graduates 
pursue their scientific carrier further in PhD thesis. 
However, graduates of biomedicine do not exercise any medical activity with a direct contact to patients. For this 
purpose, a degree in human medicine is required. In many areas, however, there is close professional cooperation 
between these two disciplines. The common expertise and understanding on the one hand and the different 
competences and skills on the other hand, promote and improve the comprehensive (clinical and scientific) 
development of medical care and health care situation. 
In addition, the Master degree in Biomedicine is also the qualification for admission to the Study Program for the 
Teaching Diploma for Secondary Education. For the Teaching Diploma for Secondary Education in Biology 
however, a broader general education in Biology is required. Modules in Biodiversity and Ecology must be 
completed additionally. Therefore, for this purpose we recommend a Major in Biology with the option of a Minor in 
Biomedicine. 
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Master's degree entitles the student to continue studying at t doctoral level. The faculty can make 
admission to a Doctorate course dependent on further conditions. The details are set out in the corresponding rules 
for Doctorates. For the Teaching Diploma for Secondary Education however, a broader general education is

Career Prospects: 
Wie viele andere universitäre Studienprogramme führt das Studium der Vergleichenden Sprachwissenschaft nicht 
zu einem bestimmten Beruf. Eines der wichtigsten späteren Tätigkeitsfelder ist die Forschung, die je nach Profil 
ganz unterschiedlich aussehen kann. Interesse an Sprache(n), Freude an Analyse und selbständiges Arbeiten sind 
aber in jedem Fall wichtige Komponenten. 
Ausserhalb der Universität ist es dank des interdisziplinären Charakters des Studienprogramms möglich, in viele 
Bereiche einzusteigen, insbesondere aber in einen der vielen Berufe, die mit Sprache, Text und Kommunikation zu 
tun haben, wie z. B. Lektorat, PR-Beratung, Übersetzung oder Sprachlehre. Je nach Interesse können die 
Kenntnisse von nicht-europäischen Sprachen, die während des Studiums erworben werden, sowie die zusätzlichen 
Qualifikationen aus den Nebenfächern auch als Grundlage dienen, in anderen Feldern wie 
Entwicklungszusammenarbeit oder Computerlinguistik tätig zu werden.

Languages of Instruction: English
Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich fünf Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Softwareentwicklung im Bereich Sprachtechnologie (IT-Firmen): Im 
Tätigkeitsfeld Softwareentwicklung plant und entwickelt man sprachtechnologische Software. 
Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, die Anforderungen zu analysieren, IT-Lösungen zu entwickeln und 
Systeme zu programmieren. Die konkreten Aufgaben hängen dabei vom jeweiligen Anwendungsgebiet ab. 
(2) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, 
Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert 
man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, 
Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich 
Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von Medienberichten, automatische 
Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme 
und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, Kundenanfragen etc.) sind 
Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(3) Terminologie- und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(4) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder der Behörde beinhalten. Die Aufgabe 
besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten und zu 
vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte sind in 
bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. Consulting 
umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der Risiken beim 
Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie. 
(5) Wissenschaft und Forschung: Im Bereich Computerlinguistik und Sprachtechnologie kann sowohl 
Grundlagenforschung wie auch angewandte Forschung betrieben werden. Universitäre Hochschulen bieten 
meistens beide Möglichkeiten, während in der Industrie und an den Fachhochschulen v.a. angewandte Forschung 
stattfindet. Die konkreten Themen sind hier sehr vielfältig und abhängig von der jeweiligen Institution und 
Forschungsstelle.

Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich drei Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, 
Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -
analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. 
Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen 
aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von 
Medienberichten, automatische Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. 
Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, 
Kundenanfragen etc.) sind Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(2) Terminologie und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(3) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder der Behörde beinhalten. Die Aufgabe 
besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten und zu 
vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte sind in 
bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. Consulting 
umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der Risiken beim 
Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie.

Major 120 Study of Religions
Description:
General description: 
The Bachelor's degree program in Religious Studies as a major program of study is designed as a wide-ranging 
scholarly introduction to the historical and contemporary relationships between religion, culture, and society. The 
core curriculum is divided into three pillars that complement one another in terms of methodology and subject 
matter. 
These pillars involve the study of religions from a historical-comparative, social science, and systematic-theoretical 
perspective. Here, basic courses impart knowledge of various religious traditions, while language courses allow for 
an in-depth study of individual sources and traditions. Methodology courses teach students various techniques for 
collecting and analyzing data. Lectures and seminars address the transformation of the meaning and function of 
religion throughout history and in the present day. 
 
The major program can be combined with a minor program of study offered the Faculty of Theology and the Study 
of Religion or another faculty.
Requirements:
Branch of Study: Study of Religions
Regulations: https://www.trf.uzh.ch/studierende/modulkataloge_ba.html
Organization:
Major/Minor-Combinations: A major in Religious Studies can basically be combined with any minor program of 
study at the University of Zurich (exception: minor program in Religious Studies).

Languages of Instruction: English
Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich fünf Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Softwareentwicklung im Bereich Sprachtechnologie (IT-Firmen): Im 
Tätigkeitsfeld Softwareentwicklung plant und entwickelt man sprachtechnologische Software. 
Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, die Anforderungen zu analysieren, IT-Lösungen zu entwickeln und 
Systeme zu programmieren. Die konkreten Aufgaben hängen dabei vom jeweiligen Anwendungsgebiet ab. 
(2) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, 
Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert 
man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, 
Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich 
Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von Medienberichten, automatische 
Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme 
und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, Kundenanfragen etc.) sind 
Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(3) Terminologie und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(4) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder der Behörde beinhalten. Die Aufgabe 
besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten und zu 
vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte sind in 
bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. Consulting 
umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der Risiken beim 
Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie. 
(5) Wissenschaft und Forschung: Im Bereich Computerlinguistik und Sprachtechnologie kann sowohl 
Grundlagenforschung wie auch angewandte Forschung betrieben werden. Universitäre Hochschulen bieten 
meistens beide Möglichkeiten, während in der Industrie und an den Fachhochschulen v.a. angewandte Forschung 
stattfindet. Die konkreten Themen sind hier sehr vielfältig und abhängig von der jeweiligen Institution und 
Forschungsstelle.

Minor 30 Digital Humanities and Text Mining
Description:
General description: 
The Digital Humanities and Text Mining minor study program is offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences 
for Bachelor's students in the Faculty of Business, Economics and Informatics, and the Faculty of Science. It gives 
insights into a coherent disciplinary field of interrelated themes and content, and allows students to choose their 
own area of focus. We live in a knowledge society where information is generally available in digital, often textual, 
form. While the information needs vary from subject to subject, there is a common denominator, as they all require 
methods and tools to automatically mark and extract the information sought in texts. The Digital Humanities and 
Text Mining study program provides an introduction to the methods and tools used in the computer-aided analysis 
of documents. The methods and knowledge acquired by participants will enable them to do simple analyses in their 
own field.
Program Outcomes: 
The goals of the program include the acquisition of a basic knowledge of programming and the methods and tools 
used to analyze digital documents.

Minor 30 History, Society, Politics
Description:
General description: 
The History, Society, Politics minor study program is offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences for 
Bachelor's students in the Faculty of Business, Economics and Informatics, and the Faculty of Science. Social and 
societal contexts have a great influence on academic disciplines, and help determine how research in these 
disciplines is accepted, promoted, and implemented. An understanding of the temporal and social dimensions and 
of political decisionmaking is therefore an important component of successful research and its application in 
society. This minor study program is designed to address this point of intersection by endeavoring to give 
participants a deeper insight into history, society, and politics. Participants can set their own area of focus through 
their choice of modules.
Program Outcomes: 
Students completing the course will be able to place the knowledge acquired in their major subject in a social, 
political, and historical context, and reflect on it accordingly.

students in the Faculty of Business, Economics and Informatics, and the Faculty of Science. It gives insights into a 
coherent field of interrelated themes and disciplines, and allows students to choose their own area of focus. 
Contextual cultural knowledge is vital in terms of enabling academic disciplines to position themselves historically 
and globally. This knowledge is acquired through an exploration of the temporally and geographically unfamiliar, as 
well as through closer investigation and analysis of the supposedly familiar. 
The study program is designed to give participants a fundamental grounding in cultural theory, cultural history, and 
interculturality, a basic knowledge of the theory and practice of cultural and artistic forms of expression, and the 
ability to reflect on and bridge cultural differences.
Program Outcomes: 
The goals of the program are for participants to a) acquire a basic knowledge of cultural theory and cultural history; 
b) rehearse intercultural dialogue (through contextual studies or language acquisition); and c) engage with cultural 
forms of expression (literature, music, visual arts, and film).

of interrelated themes and disciplines, and allows students to choose their own area of focus. Ethics deals with 
moral, social, and political issues against the backdrop of an exploration of the methodological and technical 
fundamentals of moral theories. Among other things the program is designed to enable participants to acquire a 
basic knowledge of the methodology of practical philosophy, familiarity with the classical conception of moral and 
ethical argumentation, and the ability to methodically reflect on ethical issues, and discuss or work with them 
independently at a high level of rational discourse.
Program Outcomes:

study is a Master's degree from a university or an equivalent degree. Each PhD project must receive approval from 
a professor at the Faculty of Science or from a person who has the right to confer a PhD at the Faculty of Science. 
There is no general right to be granted admission to a PhD program. Admission may be made contingent on 
conditions and/or restrictions in the form of additional coursework. 
Conditions must be met prior to admission to doctoral study; restrictions may be fulfilled during doctoral study. 
Coursework required to meet conditions and/or restrictions may not exceed a total of 60 ECTS credits; 
requirements are specified according to the demands of the subject in which the PhD thesis will be written. The 
Vice Dean of Studies decides on admission, on recognition of similar degrees, and on conditions and/or additional 
requirements that may apply. As a rule, the language of instruction in the PhD programs is English. All applicants 
whose native language is not English, or whose prior studies have not been conducted in English, are required to 
provide proof of sufficient knowledge of English.

Single Major 180 Veterinary Medicine
Description:
General description: 
Veterinary Medicine deals with all measures, including breeding, husbandry, nutrition and treatment, that promote 
animal health and wellbeing. Veterinarians carry out research on the prevention and treatment of diseases, work 
toward protecting people against illnesses contracted from animals and endeavor to apply controls on animal-
based foodstuffs. In addition, veterinarians are active in issues of animal and environmental protection. 
The Bachelor's degree in Veterinary Medicine qualifies students to continue studying toward a Master's degree.
Program Outcomes: 
The Bachelor's degree in Veterinary Medicine furnishes students with a good background in scientific, veterinary 
and medical knowledge, basic skills for veterinary procedures and basic clinical knowledge. 
Languages of Instruction: German
Career Prospects: 
The Bachelor's degree program does not prepare students to immediately embark on a career as a vet, but 
provides students with the knowledge necessary to move on to the Master's degree program in Veterinary 
Medicine. Following completion of the Bachelor's degree program, students of Veterinary Medicine generally study 
toward a Master's degree in the field.
Further Study Options: 
Attaining a Bachelor's degree entitles the student to continue studying in the same subject without having to fulfill 
further conditions. Where the subject is changed, the faculty can require proof of additional competences beyond 
those acquired in the Bachelor's program. This is also applicable to acceptance onto specialized Master's courses. 
In any event, even when the Master's course is in the same subject, the faculty can make the completion of a 
Master's degree dependent on the fulfillment of additional requirements. These requirements can also be fulfilled 
during the Master's course. The details are set out in the framework rules and the study rules.

Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
Es bieten sich vier Hauptberufsfelder an: (1) Softwareentwicklung im Bereich Sprachtechnologie (IT-Firmen): Im 
Tätigkeitsfeld Softwareentwicklung plant und entwickelt man sprachtechnologische Software. 
Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, die Anforderungen zu analysieren, IT-Lösungen zu entwickeln und 
Systeme zu programmieren. Die konkreten Aufgaben hängen dabei vom jeweiligen Anwendungsgebiet ab. 
(2) Datenanalyse und Datenerhebung (Industrie allgemein, Medienunternehmen, IT-Firmen, Verwaltungen, 
Behörden, Bibliotheken): Im Tätigkeitsfeld Datenerhebung und -analyse sammelt, produziert und/oder annotiert 
man Sprachdaten und klassifiziert, aggregiert und analysiert sie. Weitere Aufgabenschwerpunkte bestehen darin, 
Daten zu verwalten oder für unterschiedliche Verwendungen aufzubereiten und zu konvertieren. Im Bereich 
Sprachtechnologie geht es vor allem um automatische Analyse von Medienberichten, automatische 
Sentimentanalyse (z.B. für Markt- und Meinungsforschung) und Semantikanalyse. Auch Frage-Antwort-Systeme 
und automatische Klassifizierung von Dokumenten und Kurztexten (z.B. Emails, Kundenanfragen etc.) sind 
Anwendungen der Sprachtechnologie. 
(3) Terminologie und Übersetzung, Dokumentenmanagement (Firmen): Viele internationale Firmen, bzw. Firmen, 
die für den internationalen Markt produzieren, haben eigene Terminologie- und Übersetzungsabteilungen, in denen 
Computerlinguisten/-linguistinnen für die Implementation und den Ausbau bestehender Softwarelösungen 
zuständig sind. Dazu gehören neben der Pflege und Erweiterung bestehender Sprachressourcen auch das 
Trainieren von Übersetzungsverfahren anhand von neuem, ggfs. eigens dafür geschaffenem, multilingualem 
Sprachmaterial (Korpora). Auch die Evaluation von neuer Software und die Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung 
existierender Lösungen gehören zu den Aufgaben. 
(4) Consulting im Bereich Sprachtechnologie: Die Hauptaufgabe im Tätigkeitsfeld Consulting besteht darin, 
Lösungen für sprachtechnologische Fragestellungen eines Unternehmens oder einer Behörde zu finden. Dabei 
muss der Bedarf des Unternehmens analysiert und Sprachtechnologie-Methoden und -Tools evaluiert werden, um 
optimale Lösungen für die Fragestellung vorzuschlagen und deren Implementierung zu begleiten. Consulting kann 
dabei auch die Schulung und Weiterbildung von Anwendern im Betrieb oder in der Behörde beinhalten. Die 
Aufgabe besteht dann darin, computerlinguistisches Grundwissen in geeigneter didaktischer Form aufzubereiten 
und zu vermitteln. Entscheidungsprozesse für die Entwicklung und den Einsatz sprachtechnologischer Produkte 
sind in bestimmten Fällen nicht nur mit kommerziellen, sondern auch mit ethischen Fragestellungen verknüpft. 
Consulting umfasst dann als Aufgabe auch die Sensibilisierung für gesellschaftliche Chancen, aber auch der 
Risiken beim Einsatz von Sprachtechnologie.

knowledge of the history of philosophy (from antiquity and the Middle Ages to the early modern period and the 19th 
and 20th centuries), the study covers key concepts, problems, and theories from various areas of contemporary 
philosophy (logic and the philosophy of science, metaphysics, cognitive theory, the philosophy of language, 
philosophy of mind, general and applied ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics).

Major 150 Biomedicine
Description:
General description: 
The major study program Biomedicine (150 ECTS credits) teaches the relevant basic principles in Physics, 
Chemistry, Mathematics, Cell and Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics as well as 
Physiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology. The focus is on achieving an integrative view of the functions of the 
human body in connection with causes of diseases. In the area of general competencies the emphasis is on 
scientific reasoning, working and presentation. The Bachelor's degree in Biomedicine qualifies for professional 
activities requiring a profound knowledge of the human body. 
Program structure: During the first 2 years (1 - 4 semester, basic studies) the focus is on sciences such as 
Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Mathematics as well as Anatomy and Physiology. In the third year (5 and 6 
semester, Fachstudium) specific molecular aspects of the function of the human body as well as major diseases 
will be studied using biomedical research methods.
Program Outcomes: 
Graduates of the Major Study Program Bachelor in Biomedicine (150 ECTS Credits) are able to apply their sound 
knowledge in scientific, biological and medical subjects as well as in biostatistics and bioinformatics in the solution 
of biomedical questions in theory and practice and to recognize, describe and explain biomedical concepts and 
phenomena. 
 
Languages of Instruction: German, English
Career Prospects: 
A permanent professional position is hardly possible with a Bachelor's deg at best it is only possible to do an 
internship or to enter a training program in private or public companies. The prerequisite for employment is 
normally a Master's degree.
Further Study Options: 
The Major degree in Biomedicine at the Bachelor's level (Major Study Progr worth 150 ECTS Credits) entitles to 
enrol for the Major Study Programs in Biomedicine at the Master's level with no further conditions. The admissio 
related Master Programs (biology, biochemistry) is possible. For these programs, however, the formal enrolment 
may depend on the fulfilment of additional requirements or conditions. The admission to specialized Master 
programs (e.g. biostatistics) an application is necessary.
Requirements:
Admission Requirements: 
The conditions for admission to the Bachelor's degree programme are regulated in: "Verordnung über die 
Zulassung zum Studium an der Universität Zürich (VZS)".

of achievement and 1 the lowest. A grade below 4 is insufficient. Achievements can 
also be graded with 'passed' or 'failed'.
Organization:
Page 2 of 2
Program Structure: The compulsory modules (110 ECTS) of the basic studies (1st-4th semester) cover the 
natural sciences (chemistry, physics, biochemistry), the basic and applied 
mathematics (analysis, statistics, programming, data analysis), the relevant biological 
subjects (molecular genetics, cell biology, evolution and developmental biology of 
humans, microbiology, neurobiology) and the medical subjects (anatomy, physiology, 
pathophysiology, immunology, virology). In the elective modules (40 ECTS) of the 
advanced studies (5th and 6th semester), knowledge of molecular and cellular 
mechanisms of important human diseases is acquired, as well as biomedical research 
methods for their diagnosis, therapy and prevention. The main part of the 3rd year of 
study is formed by practical courses in research courses of the Faculty (e.g. in the 
Institutes of Physiology, Medical Virology, Experimental Immunology, Molecular 
Cancer Research, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Molecular Life Sciences, Anatomy, 
quantitative biomedicine, etc.) and in various University hospitals in Zurich. 
There, students get the possibility to find their thematic priority within biomedicine or to 
choose a program within the Biology Master.
Major/Minor-Combinations: The Major Study Program in Biomedicine worth 150 ECTS Credits can be combined 
with a Minor Study Program worth 30 ECTS credits. Minor Study Programs can be 
chosen from the entire range of subjects offered by the University of Zurich. 
A Minor Study Program starts in the second year of study. In the second year of study, 
all elective modules are replaced with modules of the Minor Study Program (10 
ECTS), in the third year a part of elective modules are replaced with modules of the 
Minor Study Program (20 ECTS). 
Part-Time Studies: Part-time studies are well possible due to the modular structure of the basic study 
period. However, the duration of studies will be extended and it must be noted that the 
sequence of compulsory modules of the basic study period is constructive. The third 
regular year of studies for the Bachelor's degree (advanced studies) contains block 
courses and lectures that take up the whole working week. Part-time students thus 
have to organize their time in advanced studies to ensure their presence in coherent 
time blocks of at least three and a half weeks. If necessary, the study counselling 
service can be contacted.
